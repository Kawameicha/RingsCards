    "description_md": "This deck is built using plenty of the new ALeP cards and combines two archetypes not yet played much together: Dúnedain & Wood(wo)men. It is certainly  viable for solo play and will definitively shine in a two player game. In a big fat nutshell, here is how to start:\r\n\r\n  - [Aragorn](/card/306183) gets [Estel](/card/306188), which allows him to fish for more cards from the top of the player deck right off the bat. It works even better when combined with [Elven-light](/card/10145) getting it back together with an extra card. \r\n\r\n  - [Widfast](/card/301002) allows to play [Gavin](/card/301011) right away, who generates ressources and draws more locations, less enemies or treacheries. She allows for a second active location while [Northern Tracker](/card/01045) avoids a lock.\r\n\r\n  - [Rowan](/card/305144), beside being a pretty decent defender, helps to play attachments on locations for free that synergize with the [Hunting Dogs](/card/305148) and secure extra cards and ressources.\r\n\r\nDuring the game, [Aragorn](/card/306183) will evolve into an awesome questing character as he gets more and more attachements such as [Celebrían's Stone](/card/01027), while thanks to [Andúril](/card/142014) and [Elessar](/card/306185), he can help facing enemies too. Careful combination of [Lie of the Land](/card/305147), [Gavin](/card/301011), and [Widfast](/card/301002) with the [Warden of Arnor](/card/08031) attachement garanties to quickly get rid of any locations, oftentimes even allowing to avoid a potential painful travel or active location bummer. When equipped with [Gift of Foresight](/card/303082), [Rowan](/card/305144) is an extremely solid defender who can survive most enemy attacks undamaged and [Andrath Guardsman](/card/17002), [Guardian of Arnor](/card/10116), or [Ranger of Cardolan](/card/10010) can lend a hand if enemies are swarming.",
