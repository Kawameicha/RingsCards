This may seem confusing at first; it is simply to ensure the proper number of cards are in the encounter deck for the number of players in the game.\n\nAfter being instructed to remove 4 copies of the 'Sacked!' card from the encounter deck, players are asked to shuffle 1 copy of the 'Sacked!' card per player back into the deck. Since there are 5 total copies of 'Sacked!' in the deck, the end result of this is that the game begins with 1 more 'Sacked!' card in the encounter deck than the number of players in the game.\n\n**Immune to Player Card Effects**\n\nThe Carrock, a location card in the encounter deck, has the text \"Immune to player card effects.\" This text means that players cannot select The Carrock as the target of any card effect, and that The Carrock ignores the effect of any player card that would directly interact with it.\n\n**Ally Objective Card: Grimbeorn the Old**\n\nIn this scenario, players may encounter an \"ally objective\" card, Grimbeorn the Old. If Grimbeorn is revealed from the encounter deck during the quest phase, he enters the staging area as an objective. If the players claim Grimbeorn the Old (as instructed by his card text), he becomes an ally under the control of the first player.

Because of this, the locations will not be going to the encounter discard pile, from which they might resurface later in the game.

These tests represent Gollum’s attempts to escape their pursuit.\n\nTo make an escape test, a player first commits characters to the test. A character must exhaust to commit to an escape test. Each committed character counts its [willpower] strength for the test. After committing characters to the test, the players may take actions or play event cards. If a single player is required to make an escape test, only that player may commit characters he controls to the test. If the party is required to make an escape test, all players have the option of committing characters they control to the test.\n\nOnce the characters are committed, a number of cards (as instructed by the card text dictating the escape test) are dealt from the encounter deck. Many of the cards in this encounter deck have a bold Escape value. Any card that does not have a printed escape value is considered to have a base escape value of zero. When dealing cards for an escape test, ignore all other effects on the dealt cards. Once these cards are dealt, the total committed [willpower] is compared to the total dealt escape value to determine if the escape test is passed or failed.\n\nIf the total committed [willpower] is higher than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is passed, and nothing happens.\n\nIf the total committed [willpower] is equal to or lower than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is failed, and the players follow the instructions for failing the escape test from the card that required the test be made. After an escape test, all cards dealt for that test are placed in the encounter discard pile.\n\n**Reset the Quest Deck**\n\nWhile playing this scenario, players might be instructed to \"reset the quest deck to stage 1B.\" To do this, the players take the previously defeated stage 1 quest card, and return it to the quest deck as if they are just beginning that stage. Since the quest deck is resetting to stage 1B, the setup instructions on side 1A should not be followed again. Any progress tokens that were on the current quest are removed before the quest deck resets. Progress tokens that were on the active location, however, remain on that location.

These cards are placed away from the playing area and do not interact with the game until East-gate is explored, which will add First Hall to the staging area. Exploring First Hall will then add Bridge of Khazad-dúm to the staging area.\n\n**Cave Torch**\n\nThis scenario uses the Cave Torch objective card. The first player selects any hero to attach it to, and that hero will bear the Cave Torch for the rest of the game. If Cave Torch would leave play, either through a card effect or due to the hero it is attached to leaving play itself, then it is removed from the game. When a card is removed from the game, it should be set aside and ignored for the rest of the game. Do not place any \"removed from game\" cards in the discard pile, as effects that bring cards back from the discard pile no longer interact with these cards.\n\n**Immune to Card Effects**\n\nThe location East-gate has the text, \"Immune to card effects.\" This means that East-gate cannot be selected as the target of any card effect, and it ignores the effect of any card that would **directly** interact with it. The only way to place progress tokens on it is by questing, and once East-gate is the active location it remains the active location until it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or Strider's Path would not be able to move it to the staging area).\n\n**Revealing Enemies**\n\nEnemies that are dealt as shadow cards are not considered to be revealed from the encounter deck, and do not trigger the forced response on side 2B of the quest card The Fate of Balin.",

If the card does not have \"**PASS**\" printed in its text box, then the player has not succeeded, but may attempt the test again, repeating this action until either the test is successful or he no longer wishes (*or is able to*) discard more cards. If a player runs out of cards or declares that he is not willing to discard any more cards to the test, then the test is considered a failure, and players should follow the rest of the instructions on the card that initiated the test.\n\n\"**Lost:\" Effects**\n\nSome cards have \"**Lost:**\" effects on them.

Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the First Player (which continues to move), but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently present in the game.\n\n ∙ Players cannot affect players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player's threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\n\n ∙ During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 4 players have been separated, each player would add 1 card to his staging area.\n\n ∙ Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area.

Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase. The joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in his own staging area to the staging area of the player(s) he is joining with, keeping any enemies engaged with him and discarding any active location in the staging area being left. If multiple players complete their current quest card during the same phase, they join quests starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise around the table. If there is no player to join, then players must continue to stage 5.",

        "flavorIntro": "Having escaped from the Drúadan Forest and witnessed the demise of the conspirators by the arrows of the Woses, the heroes have begun their journey back to Minas Tirith. In the morning of the second day, they awoke to a grim sight. Dozens of columns of smoke were rising across the hilly farmlands of Anórien.\nIt seems death had crossed the Anduin after all.\nAs our heroes warily approached the nearest of the fires, they came upon two farmers hiding in the hedges. The frightened bondsmen told of roving bands of orcs scouring the countryside, bringing destruction to the defenseless herdsman and farmers of the surrounding lands. They told of a particularly cruel group that assaulted the nearby village during the night. They feared the villagers were dead.\nApproaching the village, the heroes saw signs that the citizens may not have been completely helpless. Several orc bodies lay crumpled in the streets, and a crude barricade of horse carts and earth-covered hay bales protected the town’s inner square. Only the buildings on the outskirts of the town seemed to be sacked and burning.\nAs the heroes approached the barricade, the villagers eyed them suspiciously, their expressions wavering between mistrust and hope of assistance. Smoke lay in a thick haze in the streets, reddening eyes and shortening tempers.\nWhat appeared to be a nobleman and his escort of guardsmen were helping the villagers with the defenses and in caring for the wounded and burned. They seemed haggard and tired from the night’s fighting. As the heroes approached, the sooty and weary nobleman squinted through the acrid haze at the newcomers, his hand moving to his sword. Then, as a faint gust of wind cleared the air for a moment, the nobleman broke into a wide grin of recognition. It was non other than Lord Alcaron.\n“Out of the west comes hope unasked for,” he called. “May I be the first to say that you are well met indeed!”\nAfter a brief greeting, Lord Alcaron grimly told the heroes of the plight into which they had fallen, and how he had been sent northward about a month ago on the realm’s business. Denethor had deemed it wise, in case\nCair Andros should fall, to raise the levy of Anórien and prepare for the evacuation of the northlands to the safer side of the Rammas Echor. Upon receiving news of the victory at Cair Andros, Alcaron disbanded the levy, and for the past week or so has been seeing to the Stewards’ business in the region.\n“Alas” he grimaced, “even as the the victory of Cair Andros held back the tide of Mordor, the defeat must have left a substantial number of the enemy trapped on the western side of the river.” Alcaron sighed, “One would think those vile creatures would seek to return to their master by any means possible.”\n“No such luck. Instead they’ve come west to punish the local countryside, burning and murdering where they go”. Alcaron went on to tell of how the roads of Anórien had quickly become far too dangerous for traveling. Even with an armed escort, Alcaron was forced to seek the tenuous security of the present village.\n“A large group of the enemy has descended on the lands surrounding the Amon Dîn,” he continued, gesturing at the great hill that dominated the northern skyline. “They’re led by a particularly nasty captain who calls himself Ghulat.” He spat out the ugly name and pointed at the barricades. “We barely held them here last night. I don’t think they were expecting any resistance.”\n“The enemy will not make that mistake again.” Alcaron wearily glanced at a group of tired villagers leaning against a nearby wagon, armed with harvesting scythes and hayforks. “I didn’t like our chances of surviving another night.”\nHe turned to the heroes, a wide smile breaking across his sooty face. “Now that you’re here, I find cause for hope. Maybe we’ll save this village yet. What do you say?”",

        "flavorIntro": "In a great victory for Gondor, the city of Osgiliath has been retaken and the river Anduin is once more under the Steward’s control. Alongside the Lords Boromir, Faramir, and Alcaron, the heroes fought bravely to recapture the ancient city.\nWith the defeated forces of orcs and evil men retreating eastward, Lord Alcaron had urged Boromir to pursue the scattered enemy. “Don’t let a single one of them return to foul the Pelennor again!” Alcaron pleaded. “We should hunt them. Pursue them until their black bones break on the mountains.” Flush with the confidence of victory and swayed by the nobleman’s passion, Boromir agreed and asked his brother to take on this endeavor with his rangers. Faramir reluctantly consented.\nBy the request of Faramir, our heroes joined the incursion. The morning after the fall of Osgiliath, the company of rangers began their foray into the autumnal forests of Ithilien.\nIn the days that followed, the rangers managed to track and destroy a number of enemy mobs. Their carcasses were left to the elements: skeletal warnings to those of Mordor who would cross Ithilien again. It was late afternoon on the third day before the company came to the old crossroads near the foothills of the mountains.\nFaramir walked at the head of the column, our heroes and Lord Alcaron close at heel. As they came to the crossroads, Faramir crossed to the old statue that stood sentinel over the silent junction facing west. Alcaron moved to follow, but Faramir waived him back.\nThe stone figure, which must have been an impressive sight to those traveling the roads long ago, depicted a king of old seated on a throne. The years had softened its features, moss and lichen growing in its crevices and cracks. Rude scrawls and rough carvings had been made by hostile hands, defiling its stonework. The head of the statue had been knocked off, replaced with a crudely hewn stone. A coarse drawing of a grinning face with a single eye had been painted in red on the stone. The crowned head of the old king that lay to the side was curiously unmarked. It seemed the grass was greener where the head had fallen.\nAs Faramir reached the statue, he gently touched the stone as if greeting an old friend. He then knelt by the fallen face and sat for a moment. He rose slowly, carefully eying the road and surrounding terrain. No enemy had been seen since the evening before, a fact that troubled him. Above, grey clouds pressed close, and a light rain had begun to fall. In the late afternoon light, the forest seemed to have lost its color; ashen and sullen it seemed to watch their every movement in the exposed space.\nThen a look of decision crossed Faramir’s face, and he thoughtfully returned to the company. “We’ve taken this folly far enough,” he said. “There is an unkind change in the forest.” He paused a moment, glancing into the trees. “The lands so near to the Morgul Valley have been under His sway for too long. It’s unsafe to proceed.” Alcaron moved to protest, but Faramir would not abide. “My brother will have to be satisfied with the work done so far. We return to Osgiliath.”\nAs the company turned westward for their return journey, the silence of the forest broke in the blast of a distant horn. The sound rose and fell like some wounded brass bird. A chilling drone that promised nothing good.\nSuddenly, the woods all around the rangers came alive with the rushing black shapes and cruel blades of the enemy. An imposing robed figure led them, and the charging orcs gave him a wide berth. Though his face was mostly hidden by the cowl of his dark-grey robes, the man emanated terrible intent. This was no ordinary ambush.\nLord Alcaron screamed a brave challenge as he drew his sword. Faramir and his hard-eyed rangers simply pulled their blades in a steely whisper and waited for the onslaught to come.\nThe fight joined like a thunderclap..",

        "flavorIntro": "While pursuing the scattered enemy forces into Ithilien, Faramir’s company of rangers are ambushed by orcs near the old crossroads. During the ensuing fight, both Lord Faramir and Lord Alcaron are captured.\nAt the thought of Denethor’s son in Sauron’s torture chambers, the heroes begin a desperate pursuit. Following frantic hours of tracking, they find themselves at the mouth of the dread Morgul Valley.\nAs the Dead City comes into distant view, they have come upon their quarry at last.\nSeeing their pursuers close behind, the breathless Uruk are visibly frustrated. They growl angrily as they halt to confer. A hooded figure in their midst, undoubtedly their leader, calmly directs the vexed orcs. He reminds our heroes of the Morgul sorcerer who led the ambush back at the crossroads. Even while that malefactor lies dead on the forest floor, they don’t relish the thought of facing another of his kind.\nThe truth is worse. Much worse.\nThe robed figures decisively gestures at the distant tower, his demeanor brooking no debate. The tallest of the Uruk submissively throws a man-sized bundle over his shoulders. Grunting for two of its kind to follow, the Uruk starts a brisk pace eastward. The robed figure is clearly not about to risk his trophy on the doorstep of Mordor.\nAs the breakout group moves down the ancient cobblestone road, the remaining Uruk turn to face the approaching heroes. As they enter earshot, the robed figure casually claps his hands and starts to laugh. The sound is hauntingly familiar.\n“You’re incurable!” he exclaims. “Why won’t you just die!” He raises his arms in mock frustration as the Uruk pull free their weapons in a rusty cacophony. Their eyes glow with bloodlust.\n“Fortunately, you are entirely too late” the robed figure continues. He casually gestures back at the tall Uruk pacing eastward toward the ghastly city. The bundled shape of a prisoner bobs on its ironclad back. “Sauron shall have His prize.” A cloud washes away from the moon as the robed man pulls back his hood “Nothing can stop that now.”\nA sickening heartache roils the heroes. Time seems to stand still as the depth of the betrayal hits them. The sickening corpse-light of Minas Morgul seems brighter. The waters of the Morgulduin gurgle in cruel amusement.\n“It should be natural, that one as old as I should have mastered patience,” says Lord Alcaron, whose real name is Ulchor. “Yet your persistence has tested me. Congratulations!” He continues, lowering his arms dramatically. “My master wanted both the brothers, but it seems I’ll deliver only the younger.” The traitor shrugs, “still, something tells me the younger is the greater prize.” Alcaron takes a moment to study the faces of his former friends. His smile seems to brighten at the horror he sees there. “Of course, I mean to deliver him your heads as well. As a consolation.”\nThe traitor nods to the largest of the Uruk. “I’m pleased to introduce my trusted servant Murzag.” As the traitor speaks he nods to the beasts. Murzag and his companions begin to move forward, licking their blades in anticipation. “I hope you’ll find his company eviscerating.”\nAs the Uruk charge the heroes, Alcaron casually turns and begins to walk toward Minas Morgul. His laughter echoes against the valley walls where unwholesome white flowers seem to drink the sound.",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes came upon the dead rider as the afternoon darkened and the rain threatened to turn to ice.\nThey found him facedown on the old road where he lay still and broken among the yellowing grasses. Life had been hacked from his body with axes, nearly destroying the sigil of Rohan on his hauberk. Not far from him lay the remains of his horse, a proud Mearas slain by black-fletched arrows in its graceful neck.\nAs they dismounted to prepare a simple cairn for the body, a gust of western wind suddenly carried the familiar clangor of steel and screams. The dead man’s killers had found new victims.\nRain and aching bodies momentarily forgotten, the heroes remounted and urged their horses to speed.\nAs they cleared the crest of a long bracken hill, the landscape opened up to reveal the Gap of Rohan. Below them, fed by fall rains, the river Isen crawled south like a bloated serpent. The road descended the west-facing hill and led directly into the river where a ford bubbled and frothed among smooth-worn rocks.\nToday, blood and steel mingled with the waters.\nA small band of mounted Rohan warriors, knights of King Théoden’s household, were trapped at the center of the ford. From both sides of the river, scores of Wild Men from Dunland were attacking. Many of the Dunlendings brandished leather shields emblazoned with the crude sigil of an angry boar.\nWater rushing at the knees of their mounts, the knights were trying to protect an emissary in their midst. The nobleman was riding a grey mare and wore a black cloak. He flinched as the green shields of his protectors broke the deadly flight of the Wild Men’s arrows. Already, arrows had claimed two of the knights, their bloodied detritus floating among the boulders.\nThe Wild Men, tired of having their arrows deflected, began to charge. A few were already engaged in melee with the riders, but many were just now beginning to wade into the icy water with their shields raised as protection from the swords of the mounted knights. The bellowing of the attackers grew louder.\nThe heroes didn’t hesitate before they charged down the hill. The men of Rohan were friends, and what help could be given, the heroes would give.",
        "doNotRead": "As the body of the largest Dunlending fell into the river, the Wild Men finally gave up the attack. They’d thought victory to be at hand, but a group of steel-willed strangers had appeared on the eastern ridge and brought relief to the hated men of Rohan. Denied of their prize, the remaining Wild Men retreated into the rocky highlands northwest of the ford. Their blue-painted faces screamed in fury back at the victors, their axes banging and pointing to the boar sigils on their shields with promises of revenge.\nThe remaining Rohirrim knights, exhausted but pleased at their renewed lease on life, greeted the heroes with bright smiles. The senior among them was about to speak when the dark-clad emissary kneed his mare forward. He was a young man with pale skin and inky circles under his grey eyes. Thinning wet hair matted his scalp in forlorn streaks and his black cloak clung to his body like dead skin.\n“Help unlooked for is help most obliged!” The emissary’s flat voice was one of accustomed authority, but its treble betrayed the terror he’d suffered during the attack. He shot a frosty look at the knight who’d been about to speak. “It seems Threol’s lack of vigilance did not doom us after all,” said the emissary. The senior knight whom the heroes guessed to be Threol cringed at the rebuke, smile forgotten.\nThe emissary returned his dark glance to the heroes, evaluating them.\n“I am Gríma, son of Gálmód, loyal advisor to Théoden King.”\nGríma pointed northwards where the valley of Isengard lay wreathed in rain and mist. In its midst, the spire of Orthanc emerged like a black nail hammered through a grey blanket.\n“I travel with a message to the White Wizard.” As Gríma spoke, he noticed that the river’s current had pushed the corpses of two Dunlending warriors into the shallower waters of the nearby bank. He shuddered. “We must be on our way.”\nThreol cleared his throat and spoke for the first time, his gratitude to the heroes outweighing his deference to Gríma. “The King surely will reward you for the bravery shown to us today.”\n“Of course, of course.” Gríma composed himself and eyed Threol with irritation. He circled his horse to study what remained of his escort. The councillor seemed as uncomfortable among the warriors as he did with the dead Dunlendings floating nearby. Gríma raised his pale face to the wind to study the hills, calculating the odds of another attack.\nAfter an uncomfortable moment, Gríma turned his horse to face the heroes again. “We would be...honored if you would come with us to Isengard,” he said. “Your protection would be appreciated.”\n“As would your company.” Threol found his smile again.\n“Saruman is a gracious host,” Threol continued, stealing a glance at Gríma with ill-hidden dislike. Threol was clearly embarrassed by the emissary’s self-serving behavior. “Warm food and dry beds must have appeal in this cursed weather, yes? Besides, I should dearly like to share a drink with those that saved our lives here today.”\nAlmost imperceptibly, Gríma inclined his head in agreement but said nothing.\nThe heroes accepted, and the group headed northwards into the low clouds, into the Wizard’s Vale.\nInto Isengard, home of Saruman the White.",

        "flavorIntro": "Saruman received Gríma and his escort at the steps of Orthanc. The strange black tower rose coldly from the midst of Isengard’s luscious gardens. It’s ebon walls seemed out of place among the greenery of the vale and stood in stark contrast to Saruman’s brilliant white robes.\nSaruman, somehow, had already known about the affair at the ford. He lavished praise on the heroes for their rescue, and reassured Threol.\n“The Dunlendings have grown daring of late, dear Captain.” The wizard spoke with a silky voice. It was a voice that enthralled, a voice that rung wiser than the wind, and its faint lilt was as encouraging as dawn itself. “Such an attack surely could not have been imagined until this ambush.”\nThe wizard’s servants took the company’s packs and horses, and Saruman led them up the steps into Orthanc’s great front hall. The walls were made of the same glassy black substance as the tower itself, generously hung with white tapestries and lit by delicate sconces. Fires from several braziers warmed the hall yet seemed to give off no smoke.\n“The clans have never forgotten their old feud with the people of Eorl,” Saruman continued, his voice reverberating in the great hall. “The clans fight amongst each other, and they all fight Rohan.” He spoke with sadness and regret “It is a shame such bravery and strength is wasted, when the days now darken in the east.”\nSaruman glanced sideways at the heroes, keen intelligence in his gaze. “I hope one day to convince the clans to unite their efforts.” Saruman smiled, and none felt untouched by it. “For the cause of our greater good.”\nOn their fourth day in Isengard, Saruman asked the heroes to dine with him. Neither Gríma nor the Rohirrim were invited.\nThey ate in the wizard’s elaborate private study. A great balcony adjoined the room, overlooking the great cobblestone courtyard that laid before Orthanc’s front doors. A late harvest moon shone through the balcony, white and wreathed in a ghostly halo. The food and wine was splendid, rivaling even that of Denethor’s table. Saruman ate little, preferring to talk and ask questions while sipping wine.\n“I sense you are under the favor and employ of my dear friend Gandalf the Grey,” he said after concluding a bout of questions on Gondor and the disposition of Ithilien.\n“You must know that we seek the same end, Gandalf and I,” Saruman continued, pleased with his guests’ comfort and attentive ears. “While Gandalf wanders, while he turns the rocks and douses small fires, I confine myself here.” The heroes nodded in appreciation as the wizard gestured proudly around his study.\nHe sighed gently. “Here alone I study matters of the deepest significance. Of old things. Of such lessons as would help us face the rising shadow in the east.”\n“While Gandalf’s ways differ from my own, there is one thing we share in equal measure.” He smiled. “The need to retain brave allies––those of stout heart to face danger and hardship in our cause.” He toasted the heroes, and all seemed right with the world.\n“To that end, my friends, I ask you for your assistance, which I dearly hope you will choose to grant.” He steepled his hands, as if emphasizing what was to be said. He looked at each hero in kind, taking their silence as interest to learn more.\n“You already know the Orc threat has been growing in the mountains,” he continued. “In Gundabad, in Moria, near the high passes. Like the Wild Men, the servants of the enemy grow ever more aggressive.” He took a sip of wine, and his voice grew more intense. “In fact, one such band threatens the peace of this very valley.”\n“I am uncertain of the band’s numbers, but I know they are led by a particularly large and gruesome specimen of their kind––a chieftain who goes by the name of ‘Mugash.’” Saruman pursed his lips as if the word was bitter.\nThe heroes rose and spoke at once, proclaiming their willingness to destroy the Orc. Saruman waved them to their seats once more. “I am afraid it is more complicated than that,” the wizard sighed. “This chieftain, this ‘Mugash,’ has knowledge of his kin’s desires, of their movements, of their plans, and, most importantly, how they are receiving word from the east.”\nSaruman lowered his voice to a near whisper. “The task I request of you, is not to kill this specific Orc,” he curled his fingers to form a cage as he asked the impossible, “but to capture him.”",
        "doNotRead": "In hindsight, trapping Mugash was the easy part. Transporting the Orc back to Isengard was a problem unlike any the heroes had ever faced.\nAt first, they were pursued by angry remnants of Mugash’s band, often forced to halt and seek defensive ground. Yet worse than the pursuit was the journey itself. While fall storms ravaged the lowlands, early winter had come to the mountains. Gales of sleet made the path treacherous, and the wind willfully bit into every inch of exposed skin. Shallow ravines and steep rivulets, dry for most of the year, now gushed with ice-laden water. The nights froze, and every morning the stony slopes were coated in jagged ice.\nThey’d pried a staff beneath Mugash’s arms and bound his hands before him with thick rope. His legs had been forcefully bent and then tied together over another staff placed in the hollow of his knees. In this way, the heroes could drag the Orc or carry him by both poles when necessary.\nOn the first day of the return journey to Isengard, upon realizing his entrapment, Mugash had roared and yelled continually, spitting anger and snapping his fangs at his captors. His curses echoed in the mountainsides and encouraged the pursuers. After a day of listening to his screaming, the heroes had finally stuffed a piece of an old surcoat into the Orc’s fanged mouth. Using strips of leather, they tied the cloth so tight behind his head they heard his skull groan at the pressure.\nAt first, the gag seemed only to make Mugash angrier. It took another full day to traveling before he settled down somewhat, his breathing whistling angrily from frozen nostrils, eyes glaring at his captors with unvarnished bile.\nAfter three days, the pursuit finally stopped, but the weather turned for the worse. The winds howled along the cliff sides, and a mordant never-ending sleet left their faces raw and blistered.\nThere was little forage on the trail, and the heroes walked on slim rations. They dared not feed Mugash. Undoubtedly, he’d begin screaming again, and even if the pursuit had ceased, they didn’t want to chance its renewal.\nAs the heroes drew nearer to Isengard, Mugash became ill. His eyes, which were once alive with hate, became puffy and closed in feverish sleep. His nose leaked a blue-green sludge, and his breathing was reduced to a thin whistle. His dark skin had turned ashen grey, except where his limbs were pressed around the staves. There, it had bruised into a blackish purple. Mugash no longer struggled or grunted, and his weight seemed to have deadened.\nThat night, the heroes were troubled. They’d finally begun their decent into the lower passes and the weather had turned milder, but their prisoner seemed likely to die before reaching Isengard.\nReluctantly, they loosened Mugash’s bonds to improve his circulation. They removed the gag and forced hot wine and a paste of bonemeal into his foul mouth. The beast was burning with fever, so they placed him farthest from the fire near a boulder that blocked the worst of the wind. His breathing was so slight it could barely be perceived.\nThat night was the coldest of the journey, but the weather was clearing. A few stars could be seen in gaps between moving clouds and the sleet had paused. After choosing a sentry, the heroes huddled down near the fire and for the first time in their lives, they drifted off to sleep hoping that an Orc would not die.\nHours later, as the cloud-streaked moon dropped behind the south summit, the sentry thought he heard the scurrying of wolves down the mountainside. He rose to briefly investigate, but the darkness held nothing and he returned to the embers of the fire. As he settled, he no longer heard the Orc’s breathing, and so guessed the captive must have finally died. With a sigh, he rose again to investigate.\nIn the shadows of the nearby boulder, where he expected to see Mugash’s corpse, he instead saw scraps of cloth and rope. The two staves lay nearby; Mugash must have cunningly and quietly slid them inch by inch away from his body by pressing them against the boulder.\nMugash was not dead. Mugash had escaped.",

His limbs had been useless the first few miles of his escape, and he’d crawled like a worm down the mountainside, pushing himself forward with shoulders and hips. The great Orc had laughed at the pain.\nHis way, the way of the Uruk, was not one of stealth and silence, but last night on the mountainside, stealth and silence had been his closest friends.\nHe flexed his hands. Through the pain he felt strength returning. He had outwitted the hated bright-eyed humans, and now he was free.\nBut the humans, the bùbosh skai, were hunting him. He could hear their pursuing feet in the pass above him. He spat, tasting the stale rag that had been jammed in his mouth for days. When revenge came, he would feed hot coals to his former captors.\nAs Mugash thought of his imprisonment, a blood rage almost took him, but he resisted the urge to turn and fight. He knew the skill of these particular skalug, and fighting them now would be foolish. Mugash was no fool. He’d become chieftain of the southern tribes through more than strength and violence. Vengeance would wait. He’d fight another night.\nHow Mugash wished it was night! The sun had risen, and its vile sharpness was like a blade in his eyes. Even so, the great Orc forged on. He’d always prided himself on his resistance to the white eye. Though it hurt him, unlike most of his tribesmen––he endured its viscous glare,. Even so, the bright path was hard to see and the pain was another tax on his punished body.\nHe’d thought of escaping back along the mountain path, but the ice would have slowed him further. Instead, he hobbled east, down the mountainside and eastward, into the damned rising white eye. Into the lower lands. Into the trees.\nAs the forest shadows shielded him from the sun, he grunted with relief. The southern forest, with its dense canopy of ancient trees, made for an almost-subterranean world, twilit in greens, browns, and blacks. He would have preferred a dark tunnel or cave, but this was not a bad place.\nThe great Uruk took a ragged breath and renewed energy came to him. He soon disappeared into the shadows of the primordial forest. It would be impossible for the bùbosh skalug to find him there.\nMugash soon learned he was wrong. This forest was, after all, a bad place.\nNot far behind, the heroes followed in close pursuit. They’d caught the monster once, and were determined to do it again. Yet even the strongest determination could not stop them from hesitating when they realized that Mugash had ventured into the old forest of Fangorn, a place with a dark and dangerous reputation.\nAs they entered Fangorn, the air hummed with a subtle song of branch and leaf, and the tune was unkind. They’d come to a place forgotten by the world and abandoned by time. One that wished to remain so.\nThe trees and stone watched, as they always had. A humid wind whispered in the branches, and old memories stirred in bark and root. Sleeping things woke from sour dreams. Things that hated disturbance. Hated the smell of change and steel and fire that clung to the intruders.",
        "doNotRead": "As the trees gave way to the boulder-strewn grasslands of the mountainside, their spirits revived.\nThe heroes had awoken the anger of ancient things with rotten hearts. They’d fought the crushing power of old roots and strangling branches and they’d barely escaped alive. Now those horrors were behind them.\nThe great Orc, Mugash, was their prisoner once more, and after another two days of traveling, they finally descended on the winding path that led into the Wizards Vale from the north. Orthanc greeted them coolly among the welcoming colors of the vale’s vegetation.\nSaruman was grateful for their help in capturing the Orc, and his rewards were generous.\nThe heroes spent the winter in Isengard, recovering from their ordeals in the mountains and forest. Yet, as the season passed, the heroes saw less and less of the wizard. He was often closeted with work in his chambers, and they sensed a growing frustration in him, as if the results were not to his liking.\nUpon seeing the telltale sign of summer birds returning north in the high skies, the heroes felt their northward journey must resume. Over a rare dinner with the wizard in his high study, they told him of their plans to depart the following morning. Saruman seemed displeased.\n“My work is unfinished, my friends,” he began as a servant refilled his goblet. The wizard sipped at the wine and continued. “The Enemy is wise, and he remembers such secrets of old that even the Elves have forgotten.\n“It is of great consequence that we learn the depths of the Enemy’s measure and mind,” Saruman continued. “It is with knowledge of the past, and in the powerful weapons of yore, that I perceive our greatest chance.” He took another sip, considering his next words. “Did others not defeat Sauron and his master before? Should we not seek the old powers of Beren, of Gondolin, of Númenor?” The wizard leaned forward. A hungry, eager, light was in his eyes. “Of Isildur?”\nThe heroes gleaned the flaw in Saruman’s speech. If Sauron had truly been defeated, then how could he have returned to power? It seemed to them that weapons of the past had merely held the shadow at bay. They didn’t voice their doubts, however, for the wisdom in Saruman’s voice quickly dulled all qualms.\nSaruman continued his lecture. “I believe a long-lost place, one thought destroyed by the enemy, may have been uncovered in the hills of Hollin. It was among those hills that the great Elven city of Ost-in-Edhil stood, and it was there Celebrimbor and his apprentices forged legendary artifacts of good, unmatched in the world today.”\nSaruman’s back had straightened and he seemed to glance into the past, as if he saw the forge fires of the long-dead Elven masters. His voice became deeper and his bearing mightier. The heroes felt, rather than saw, the secret light of the Istari pulsing from him, like heat from a searing oven. “Is it not incumbent upon us to seek the tools and weapons of a better age?” It was not a question he expected the heroes to answer.\nAfter a few moments, his reverie seemed to recede and, his gaze returning to the dinner table. “Word has come to me from the north. A Dwarf by the name of Nalir claims to have found a hidden Elven forge near Hollin.” Saruman paused, as if hoping for a reaction from the heroes. When none came, he seemed slightly irritated. “Nalir is waiting in Tharbad and desires to sell the forge’s whereabouts for a substantial sum of gold.” Saruman’s intonation made it clear he valued the precious metal no more than the crumbs on his plate.\n“I believe this may be nothing less than the forge of Celebrimbor himself.” He folded his hands. “And it may prove a vital link to past strengths.”\nThe wizard now looked at each of the heroes in turn. “I know you wish to return to Rivendell,” he said. “I admire your dedication to Gandalf’s trifling endeavors. Yet I need your skills in exploring this place and procuring what it may contain.” The heroes shuffled uncomfortably in the seats. Their absence from the north had been long, and the grey wizard’s need was keenly on their minds.\nAs Saruman caught their hesitation, the enticement of his words seemed to magnify.\n“My friends, I ask you most kindly. Travel to Tharbad for me and procure the forge’s location from this Dwarf. Then reconnoiter the forge and recover its contents for me. Do this, and you may rejoin Gandalf with my blessing and eternal friendship.” Saruman’s shadow seemed to grow as he spoke, and the room felt suddenly small. “It is of greater importance than I can ask you to understand.”\nThere was a moment of tense indecision, then the heroes, one by one, gave their nods. As the reluctance ebbed, Saruman relaxed. He smiled sweetly, greeting their acquiescence with a statesman’s grace.\n“I knew you would not turn from duty,” Saruman said. His words seemed to stroke them as a master’s hand would his faithful dog. “With luck, your quest may help plant the seeds of a better age.”\nIt seemed their work for Isengard was not yet finished.",

        "flavorIntro": "In the circle of Isengard, the heroes were preparing themselves for the journey to Tharbad. The leader of the White Council, Saruman, had tasked them with an important quest: to find the hidden forge of Celebrimbor, the master Elf-smith who forged Rings of Power in the Second Age. The Wizard believed that knowledge of Celebrimbor’s secret forge could be learned from a Dwarf who they were to meet in Tharbad.\nThe heroes were tightening their belts and shouldering their bags when Saruman descended the stairs of Orthanc to wish them farewell. “This gold should be sufficient to convince the Dwarf, Nalir, to sell you his map,” the Wizard said as he handed a heavy purse to the heroes. “Guard it well. For the location of Celebrimbor’s forge is a prize beyond worth, and we dare not let the servants of the Enemy find it in our stead.”\nThe heroes added the gold to the bag of valuables that they had recovered from the Orcs of Methedras, then Saruman bid the heroes hasten and returned to his tower. The heroes themselves mounted their steeds and rode south from the ring of Isengard until they reached the Old South Road that would lead them to Tharbad where Nalir could be found.\nThe road ran west and north through the hill country of Dunland and they rode until sunset. As the red sun burned low in the distance, the heroes gathered around a fire to keep warm and ease the weariness in their limbs. But just as sleep began to close their eyes, they were startled wide open by the sound of war cries from all around. A host of bearded Dunlendings was swarming down the hills towards them with weapons drawn...",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes were bound hand and foot inside a wood lodge of the Dunlendings. Outside they could hear the warriors of the Boar Clan celebrating their victory, when a large Dunlending entered. It was the leader of the war-party that assaulted them, and the same Wild Man who ordered them taken prisoner. He approached the heroes until he stood towering over them.\nThe war-chief stared intently at the heroes, holding the totemic amulet taken from their baggage. “I am Turch, chieftain of the Boar Clan. Every ten years, an amulet like this is given to a youth of great promise,” he began. “The gift marks the height of his manhood and signals his worthiness to undertake the three trials.”\nHis eyes grew distant, and for a moment sadness washed over his stern face. Then, with a deep breath he hardened his face and continued, “This amulet was given to my son.”\nAt that moment, an elder Dunlending man wearing ritual boarskins and the bones of his totem animal entered. “You would reveal our secrets to these strangers?” He asked in a sharp voice, indicating the heroes with a sweep of his arm. “They are not Boars!”\nThe chief glared at the druid, “I am the chief of this tribe! I will speak what I like.”\nThe old man fell silent and bowed his head. When the chief returned his attention to the heroes, he held up the amulet in his weathered hand and resumed his story, “Whoever succeeds at these trials will recover the Antlered Crown and unite our people. My son journeyed into the forest near the mountains to attempt the trials several years ago. He never returned.” The chief’s eyes were haunted when he met the heroes’ gaze. “No other youth showed such promise, and none of his peers dared to take his place. To my shame, the Boar Clan has no champions to undertake the trials when the moon grows full this night.”\nOnce again, the old man interrupted, shaking his fist towards the chief. “These strangers wear the trappings of our enemies! We dare not trust them!”\nThe chief held up a hand to silence the wise man and kept his gaze on the heroes. “I see now that my son was slain by the Orcs you encountered,” he said. “It is good that Saruman sent you to deal with them.” Then, scratching his beard thoughtfully, he spoke to himself, “The friendship of Isengard in addition to the Antlered Crown would force the other clans to recognize the leadership of the Boar Clan.”\nHe seemed to ponder that idea a moment. Then, turning his attention back to the heroes, he spoke to them, “You avenged my son by dealing with the Orcs that killed him, and you fought well when we ambushed you. I believe that my son’s spirit is with you.”\nThe chief looked down at the amulet one last time before reaching forward to offer it to the heroes. “If you remain here, my people will demand your death. Instead, it is my wish that you take the trials in my son’s place and retrieve the Antlered Crown. If you do this, you will be spared and free to continue the Wizard’s errand.”\nBefore the heroes could reply, the old druid pounded his staff on the ground and shook it violently. “You cannot do this! They are not Boars! They cannot undertake the trials!”\n“Consult the bones,” ordered the chief as he rose to his feet and towered over the old man. “Let the Boar spirit decide.”\nThe old druid reached inside his boarskins and reluctantly brought out a small purse. He opened the pouch to let the small bones inside it spill onto the ground, then he bent to his knees and lowered his face to inspect them closely.\nAfter a tense minute of silence, the old man grunted, and rising slowly to his feet he spoke slowly, “The strangers may undertake the trials.”\n“The bones have spoken,” spoke the chief. “It is decided then: You will undertake the trials to recover the Antlered Crown for the Boar Clan. Success will grant you and your master our friendship. Failure will grant you death.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Looking at Tharbad, the heroes were dubious. The river town was little more than a haven of freelancers and highwaymen, filled with dilapidated buildings amongst ruined and crumbling causeways. As soon as they entered the ancient city, they inquired with several townsfolk to discover where they might find Nalir.\nIn due time, the heroes were pointed in the direction of a patched and ramshackle tavern, The Empty Mug. Once inside, the heroes found the Dwarf they sought sitting alone with a tankard of ale. His appearance did little to inspire confidence in the heroes, but there was a glint in his eyes when they spoke of the map that revealed a cunning mind at work.\n“Aye, I have the map you seek,” he said, wiping the ale from his mouth. “However...” he continued slowly, “I sold it to a man earlier today, name of Bellach. A shady looking character, he was. Not the sort of man to take ‘no’ for an answer. But he offered a fair price, even if he was foul about it. I’m to meet him here at sundown to make the exchange... Unless you can offer a better price?” Nalir punctuated his question with a sly grin.\nThe heroes were eager to purchase the map, and Nalir used it to his advantage. It took all the gold from Saruman’s purse to convince the Dwarf to sell the map to them, but in the end a deal was struck. “Done!” exclaimed Nalir, clapping his hands together. “A nice bit of business! Now let’s finish it quick before that Bellach returns. I’d like to be far from here before he finds out I’ve sold the map to you. I don’t imagine he’ll take the news kindly.”\nWith that, Nalir stood up from his seat and moved his chair aside to get at the floorboard it had been sitting on. He lifted the board and took a rolled parchment from underneath. “Here’s the map I drew. It shows the way to the hidden chamber in Ost-in-Edhil,” he spoke with obvious pride. “Lucky to find it, I was. Elves are right clever about hiding things they don’t want found. Another Dwarf might’ve walked right over it without ever knowing it was there. I daresay you’d never find it on your own! But now that you’ve got Nalir’s map, you don’t have to worry about that...”\nHe was just about to hand his map to the heroes when there was a shout from the doorway. A tall man in a dark cloak stood there. He had a cruel scar across his face and his right hand was on his sword hilt. Several more sinister-looking men stood behind him.\n“Bellach!” exclaimed the Dwarf.\n“Is that the map you sold to me?” demanded the man in the doorway pointing at the parchment Nalir was about to give the heroes. There was murder in Bellach’s eyes. “You have made a foolish mistake,” he snarled, then put his fingers to his lips and made a loud, shrill whistle. To the heroes’ dismay, it was answered by the unmistakeable sound of Orc shouts from outside the tavern.\n“Kill them!” Bellach shouted to his followers as he drew his own sword. “In the name of Mordor! Bring me the map!”\nNalir wasted no time fleeing for the back door as Bellach’s men rushed inside. A roar of shouts and clanging steel filled the little tavern. Just as Nalir reached the door, it was thrown open from the outside by a large Orc. The Orc seized the map that was in Nalir’s hand, but the Dwarf ’s grip was strong. After a brief struggle, there was a loud ripping sound as the map was torn in two.\n“You fool!” snarled Bellach at the Orc with half a map in its hand.\nIn that brief moment of distraction, the heroes saw their chance. Grabbing Nalir, they shoved past the bewildered Orc and sped down the alleyway behind the tavern, the sound of pursuit close behind...",

        "flavorIntro": "With Bellach’s Orcs scouring the country around Tharbad looking for the Dwarf, Nalir, the heroes had chosen to flee with him into the Nîn-in-Eilph, a vast swampland that had been undisturbed for ages. By taking this path the heroes hoped they would throw the Orcs off their trail and come to Hollin on the other side. But after wandering for a day through the pathless marsh, the heroes were growing tired and Nalir’s complaints were getting louder.\n“I told you this was a bad idea,” Nalir grumbled as he struggled through the marsh and sank to his chest. “I don’t like to get closer to water than the riverbank. Dwarves don’t swim, you see.” Despite the roguish Dwarf’s protests, the heroes trudged on. The mission they had undertaken for Saruman to find Celebrimbor’s forge was important, and all the more urgent now that the Enemy was searching for it too.\nNalir, however, cared little for Saruman and less about his mission. He had only agreed to make the crossing with the heroes for fear of the Orcs, but there was something about the swamp that made him more afraid. As they slogged through the endless marsh, they began to hear noises like gentle splashes.\nA foul smell overtook the heroes and a sense of dread stopped them where they stood knee-deep in the swamp. Unconsciously, they drew their weapons and faced outward to see the murky water rippling toward them.\nNalir thought he saw a long dark shape snake its way across the surface. “There’s something out there,” muttered the Dwarf. The heroes strained their eyes but could see nothing through the fog that had settled over the swamp.\n“We can’t stay here,” said Nalir, trying to stay near the center of the group. “We’ve got to find a way out.”\nThe heroes knew he was right. Whatever dangers lurked in the Nîn-in-Eilph, the heroes would have to brave them in order to reach the other side...",

From their vantage point, they could see the man, Bellach, as he ordered the search.\n“I should’ve guessed that scum would get here first,” hissed the Dwarf. “He must’ve led the Orcs here while we were lost in that swamp.”\nThe heroes looked on the scene with dismay. After all their travels, it seemed they had come too late to accomplish their mission. Then Nalir noticed something that made him growl, “He’s got the other half of my map with him! Look, he’s using it to direct the Orcs.” Suddenly the Dwarf started laughing, “That fool! He’ll never find the hidden chamber with just half. He’s searching in the wrong spot!”\nNalir’s news gave the heroes hope that they may yet discover Celebrimbor’s forge and recover its secrets before Bellach and his Orcs. However, the Dwarf had gone as far as he would, “What you do from here is your business, but with all these Orcs searching about, I daren’t go down there. If we’re seen by those Orcs, even warriors of your mettle may not survive.” The heroes objected but it was clear that Nalir could not be convinced to lead them any further. “I’ll tell you where I found the hidden chamber,” said the Dwarf, “but I’m not going nowhere near that many Orcs. I doubt if anybody could make their way through that valley without being spotted.”\nNalir did his best to describe where the entrance to the hidden chamber was located before wishing the heroes luck and slipping away. He gave one last dubious look at the heroes before disappearing out of sight.\nTurning back to the matter at hand, the heroes look out over the vale of Ost-in-Edhil and try to discern the entrance to the hidden forge at the valley’s end. They would have to move with great stealth if they wished to evade Bellach’s forces and reach the end of their quest.",

        "flavorIntro": "The signs of war littered the hills of Dunland. Everywhere the heroes looked there was smoke and blood and fire. Across a wide valley, the bodies of Dunlending warriors lay slain in the dirt. Some wore the trappings of the Boar tribe, others were dressed with Raven feathers.\nAs the heroes searched the battlefield for survivors, they were alerted to an approaching troop by the tromp of marching feet. Looking in the direction of the sound, they descried the banners of the Boar Clan flying above an army of Wild Men. Striding proudly at the front was chieftain Turch wearing the Antlered Crown. He halted when he saw the heroes.\n“Well met,” said the chief with a smile. “I am glad to see you again, but you cannot travel any further; our country is at war.” His face was stern, but his eyes were weary.\nHe removed the Antlered Crown and wiped his brow, then regarded the thing in his hand and frowned. “The Antlered Crown has not united the Dunlending clans as I had hoped. The leader of the Raven Clan has rejected my leadership and laid claim to the crown for himself, instigating this fight.” The large chieftain spat in the dirt to show his disdain.\n“The cowards of the Wolf Clan have reserved their allegiance for the moment, but if they should ally with the Raven, I fear we will be overmatched,” he explained. Then, looking at the heroes he continued, “Yet, if the emissaries of Saruman were to ally themselves with us, the Boar Clan would surely be victorious! And you would return to Isengard with the friendship of a united Dunland. What say you?”\nThe heroes were reluctant to fight in the Dunlendings’ war. Yet, even if they refused, it seemed unlikely that they could escape Dunland unscathed. Better to fight alongside the Boar Clan than to flee into danger, they decided, especially if it meant they might earn friendship of the Wild Men for Saruman. Surely the threat of Mordor demanded that all free peoples unite together?\nSeeing an opportunity to strengthen the West, the heroes agreed to march with Turch and his clan.\n“Excellent!” bellowed the Boar chieftain. “Come, the Raven Clan is still scattered among the hills. We must find their chief before he gathers the rest of his clan to him. If we defeat the chief of Ravens, the rest of his clan will submit.”\nChieftain Turch placed the Antlered Crown back on his head and signaled to his men, “We march!”",

        "flavorIntro": "The House of Elrond was bustling with preparations. Fall was turning the leaves on the trees of Rivendell to flaming colors, and the valley echoed with the singing of merry voices. The Elves were gathering the last of the summer harvest to celebrate the Autumnal Equinox. All were busy except the Master of the House and his guests, a band of weary travelers who had recently arrived from important errands in Gondor and Dunland. The heroes were tired from a journey of many leagues fraught with peril, and Elrond had welcomed them to rest in his home and tell what they could of their adventures.\nIn the Hall of Fire, Elrond spoke with the heroes at length concerning their service to the White Council. Many great deeds they had done to forestall the growing power of Mordor, and for their acts of valor, Elrond made them honored guests and bid them stay until they were refreshed.\nWhile they spoke with the Elf-lord, a messenger entered the Hall to announce another traveler newly come to Rivendell. Behind him stood a tall man of proud bearing. He wore the weather-stained garb of a Ranger. From the man’s appearance, it was clear that his errand was urgent.\n“Mae govannen, Dúnadan,” said Elrond, “The sons of Valandil are welcome in Imladris.”\nThe Ranger placed his hand over a hawk pendant he wore on a chain around his neck and bowed. “My lord,” he spoke, “My name is Iârion, and I have ridden here in haste to seek my kinsman, Aragorn. There is evil afoot in the untamed lands north of Bree, and we Rangers have need of our Chieftain.”\n“The son of Arathorn is not here,” answered Elrond. Gesturing for the Ranger to sit in the empty chair next to him, he continued: “But tell me more of your errand. Long have the Dúnedain kept the villages of Bree safe with secret vigil, yet seldom have they sought for aid in that thankless task. What evil drives you here now?”\nThe Ranger took the seat that was offered to him before explaining: “Orcs have been discovered west of the Weather Hills in greater number than we have seen them in many years. They are spying out the land, and we believe they plan to attack.”\n“Alas, Aragorn is far afield with my sons and the warriors of my house,” replied Elrond. “Until they return, I have no one to send to your aid.”\nIârion looked downcast but mastered himself before speaking: “Then I must return at once to my kinsman and help them prepare as best I may.”\n“I will tell your Chieftain of the threat to his people as soon as he returns,” said the Elf-lord.\nThe Ranger stood up, bowed to Elrond, and turned to leave, but the heroes who were sitting there rose to their feet and stepped forward. “We will come with you,” spoke one, and the rest nodded in agreement.\n“I thank you strangers,” replied Iârion. “But as Master Elrond has said, our deeds are secret and thankless; we Dúnedain receive no reward for our sacrifice, and neither do we have any to offer.”\n“Hunting Orcs is its own reward,” said the hero evenly, and continued, “we will not sit idle here while you and your folk fight this battle. Not while we have strength left. We will come.”\n“Then let us ride swiftly to the aid of my people,” said Iârion with fresh hope in his eyes.\n“May the favor of the Valar be upon each of you in this task,” spoke Elrond in farewell.\nTogether the Ranger and the heroes bade farewell to the Last Homely House. They rode west from the valley of Rivendell toward the villages of Bree-land. They followed the Old Road over the Last Bridge all the way to the southern end of the Weather Hills. There they turned aside to climb Weathertop, the tallest of the hills. Its summit commanded a great view of the surrounding area, and Iârion told his companions there would be Rangers keeping vigil there. From them, the Dúnadan hoped to learn some news before pressing on.\nWhen they reached the top, they found two Dúnedain who greeted them. “Ho, Iârion. I see you have brought others to help us, but I fear it may be too late,” one of them said grimly. “A large number of Orcs descended from the hills last night. A war party it seemed to us, but moving warily and avoiding the road. We watched them creep north and west along the edge of the marsh until they disappeared beyond the fens.”\n“It is likely that they mean to come upon the villages of Bree-land from the north,” replied Iârion looking in the direction the Rangers indicated. “Our people in Chetwood must be warned! One of you take my horse and ride with haste to do so. My companions and I will follow the Orcs and do what we can do to delay them.”\nTurning to the heroes, Iârion laid his hand on the pommel of his sword as he addressed them: “There are many lonely homesteads north of Bree. We must do what we can to track these Orcs and safeguard those people. Come!”",
        "doNotRead": "Iârion leaned on the hilt of his sword and watched the last of the Orcs flee to the east, away from peaceful villages near at hand. The Ranger and his company of heroes had chased their quarry to the very borders of Bree-land, where they forced their enemy to turn and give battle.\nThe war-party was better armed and better disciplined than the sort of ordinary rabble the Ranger was accustomed to hunting, but in hindsight it seemed clear to Iârion that the Orcs were bent more on pillaging than fighting, for they broke and fled after only a short battle.\n“Clearly these Orcs did not expect to be met by such determined resistance,” said one of the heroes triumphantly, looking down at the body of the last Orc they had slain before the rest turned to flee.\nRoused from his tired musings, Iârion turned to face them and replied gravely, “Yes, but the audacity of their attack unnerves me; the Orcs have not dared to venture this far west in years. What is it that leads them here now?”\nThe heroes could see the concern in the Ranger’s eyes, and the rush of victory faded as they considered the implications of his question.\n“I’m afraid our work is not yet finished, my friends,” said Iârion, gazing into the distance. “There is to be a gathering of the Dúnedain at Fornost in a few days to celebrate the Autumnal Equinox. I must go thither with news of this attack for I fear it is but a prelude of things to come, and the Rangers must be ready for what follows.”\nTurning to the heroes with him, Iârion continued, “However, we cannot allow those Orcs that fled to escape, or they may return again in even greater numbers. Since I must go to Fornost, I ask you: will you track them in my stead?”\nFrom the strained look in his eyes, the heroes could see how hard it was for the honorable Ranger to burden them with this dangerous task, so they made him an oath that none of the Orcs who had ventured so close to Bree would live to return again.\n“Well said,” replied Iârion. Then, he raised his sword in salute and spoke, “May the spirit of Oromë guide you on your hunt!”\nWith that, the Ranger sheathed his blade and hurried away. The heroes watched him head north along the Greenway for a minute before turning their eyes to the east and the trail of their enemies.",

        "flavorIntro": "For days, the heroes pursued the remnants of the war-party east from Chetwood across the northern edge of Midgewater Marshes and into the wide plain beyond. Along the way, they came upon several burnt homesteads. Each was plainly the work of Orcish savagery. However, at each home, the heroes were surprised to find no bodies. Instead, they found signs of struggle and the unmistakable tracks of Orcs dragging their captives away.\n“Why would retreating Orcs stop to take prisoners?” asked one of the heroes, examining the impressions on the ground.\n“Perhaps they think to ransom their lives?” answered another as they emerged from the charred ruin of a collapsed hovel.\n“One or two prisoners would have sufficed if that were their intent, but these Orcs have taken a dozen at least,” replied the first. “Look at the markings here.”\nThe hero in the doorway knelt by their companion to examine the earth more closely. After a minute they said, “I think I see the answer to this riddle: The Orcs we chase are not the same that attacked this home, though it is likely that they are in league with each other. Look here! The prints made by this family as they struggled against their captors are at least a full day older than those of the Orcs we have pursued here.”\nThe rest of the heroes agreed that they were right, but this discovery did little to ease the group’s mood since it suggested the attack near Bree was only part of a larger plot. There was a brief silence as each member of the company contemplated what that might be.\nAt length, one of them spoke, “If the Orcs are in league together, then it is likely that the ones we hunt will lead us to their meeting place. There we may hope to find those who were captured. Even if we cannot rescue them, we can at least avenge ourselves upon their captors!” The rest agreed that this was their only course of action, and they resumed the chase.\nThe Orcs’ trail led them north and east towards the Weather Hills. As they marched, the sky above them grew dark with clouds driven by a chill wind out of the north. By the time they reached the first rocky slope of the hills, it was unusually cold.\nThe heroes drew their cloaks about them, but it did little to keep out the frosty air. As freezing rain began to fall on the heroes, one of them lifted their eyes skyward and said aloud, “This is an ill omen, my friends. The weather turns against us and washes out our trail. I fear there is some new evil at work here that gives aid to our enemies.”\nThere was some murmur of agreement among the company before another spoke up, “It matters not whence the rain comes or if the trail ends; our quarry hides somewhere in these hills, and we must find them or forsake their captives and our oath.”\nThere was a hushed ring of steel as each of the heroes drew his weapon in silent reply. The heroes pulled up their hoods and began to search the hills for sign of the Orcs...",
        "doNotRead": "The Orcs had made their camp inside an old Dúnedain border-fort built at the northern edge of the Weather Hills in the Second Age during the war between Arnor and Angmar. The ancient wooden gates were destroyed with age and the Orcs could not stop their pursuers from entering in. Once inside, the heroes fulfilled their oath to Iârion by slaying every Orc they found hiding among the ruins.\nAfter the fighting was finished, the heroes cleaned the blood from their weapons and began searching for the Orcs’ captives. Inside what might once have been the great hall of the fort, they found the mutilated bodies of several villagers. Their desecrated corpses were arranged at the center of an evil pattern on the floor. The victims had clearly been sacrificed as part of some unholy sacrament, but none could guess what it was. Then did the heroes rue their decision to slay all the Orcs without questioning them first.\n“This is not Orc work,” said one of the heroes who looked with horror at the scene. “This is foul sorcery.”\n“Aye, but whose?” asked another in reply.\n“Let us search the rest of the fort in hopes that we may find the answer,” said a third, covering his mouth and turning his face away from the bodies.\nAt the far end of the hall, they found a darkened stairway leading down. The heroes lit a torch and descended the narrow passage as it twisted its way underneath the fort. At the bottom of the stairs they found a dank cellar sealed by a locked door. From inside they could hear the sounds of shuffling and whimpering.\nThe heroes forced the door open and thrust a torch inside. The flickering orange light revealed a small group of survivors huddled together in a corner. They appeared half-starved, and they shivered in the cold dungeon. The heroes removed their cloaks and placed them around the unfortunate prisoners to help warm them.\nThe air was cleaner outside, so the heroes led the survivors back up the stairway and away from the dungeon. But as they passed the bodies in the hall, the rescued captives screamed and wept.\n“Who has done this?” asked one of the heroes, but they were too distraught to answer.\nOutside the wind had died down and the rain had stopped. The heroes lit a fire in the courtyard of the old fort and the survivors gathered around it. At length, an older man named Thaurdir spoke, “We didn’t see what happened. We couldn’t. They kept us locked in that dungeon for days without any light. We could only hear the screams...” His voice trailed off.\nThe man’s hood covered most of his face so the heroes could not see his expression. After a moment he continued, “We could hear the harsh voices of the Orcs too, but there was another voice that commanded them. I don’t know what kind of creature it was, but it was terrifying to hear.”\n“We found none but Orcs when we arrived here,” spoke one of the heroes.\n“Then it must have escaped,” answered the old man.\n“If that is so, we cannot stay here,” replied the hero. They turned to their companions and said, “We should take these people to Fornost where the Rangers are gathered. Iârion will want to hear what they can tell him of their capture.” Turning to the former prisoners, he said, “You will be safe there.”\nThe rest of the heroes voiced their agreement, but the traumatized survivors merely nodded. After they had given their charges something to eat and water to drink, the heroes began their slow march to Fornost.",

        "flavorIntro": "It was a long journey from the Weather Hills to Fornost Erain, made longer by the weary survivors the heroes were escorting. The unfortunate villagers had suffered much hardship during their captivity, and the unusually cold weather did not improve their condition. Soon they were all sick from their ordeal. In the end, the heroes had to send a runner ahead to summon help from the Dúnedain they were seeking.\nWith help from the Rangers, the heroes were able to bring the survivors safely to Fornost. Once the capital of Arthedain, the ancient city was abandoned after the war with Angmar, almost a thousand years ago. Now the desolate ruin was called Deadmen’s Dike, yet on high days, the Dúnedain still gathered there, as they did now.\nIârion and a younger Ranger were there to greet them when they entered the city gates. The noble Dúnadan had a look of wonder on his face as he watched the heroes bring the survivors inside the walls. “You have exceeded your oath in saving these people,” he exclaimed. “On behalf of the Dúnedain, I thank you friends. Come, join us at the council fire and tell us your tale. My brother, Amarthiúl, will take care of your charges.”\nThe younger Ranger, a man of good stature, brought the survivors to see the healers while Iârion led the heroes to the central square of the city. A council of Dúnedain were gathered there around a large fire. In the place of honor was their Chieftain, Aragorn, son of Arathorn. He looked at the heroes with keen interest as Iârion introduced them, “Here is the valiant company that helped us defend the villages of Bree-land and pursued our enemies to their hiding place in the Weather Hills. They have come here with the survivors they rescued from the Orcs, and with evil news.”\nThe heroes described for the Rangers the details of their adventure: the burnt homesteads, the Orcs’ captives, the old border-fort of Amon Forn, and the grisly sacrifices. After the whole account had been made, there was a long silence before Aragorn finally spoke.\n“Your tale is full of woe,” said the son of Arathorn, “We have not heard of such evils since the fall of ancient Angmar.”\n“Indeed,” replied Iârion, “their tale bears the very trappings of Angmar. The king of that cursed land was a powerful sorcerer, and many stories such as theirs were heard in his day.”\n“Aye,” answered Aragorn, “but the armies of Angmar were defeated, and the Witch-king fled the North. That fell wraith now commands the fortress of Minas Morgul and threatens Gondor with war. These foul deeds cannot be his doing.”\n“And yet the crimes we hear of now are the same as were uncovered in this very city when it was recovered from Angmar many years ago,” insisted Iârion. “If they are not the Nazgûl’s work, then perhaps one of his disciples has returned to take his place?”\nAs the Dúnedain debated this question, the setting sun fell behind the hills of Evendim to the west, and the sky darkened above them. From another part of the city there came a shrill cry, and a moment later Amarthiúl came running towards the council.\n“Iârion! Iârion!” he shouted between breaths. “We are betrayed!”\n“What is it?” asked Iârion. “What has happened?”\n“Black sorcery!” said Amarthiúl, seizing Iârion’s arm. “One of the survivors. The old man. The one called Thaurdir. He...” The younger Ranger took a breath, “He is a wraith!”\n“A wraith? How did you learn this?” asked Iârion with an astonished voice.\n“When I brought the survivors to see the healers, I saw the old man slip away. I thought that suspicious, so I followed him in secret,” explained Amarthiúl, speaking quickly. “He walked straight to the tombs and there cast aside his cloak. His face was drawn and withered like a corpse, but his eyes!”\nThe young Ranger blanched, and then continued, “I made no sound, yet he looked straight at me where I hid among the shadows, and I knew he could see me with those hollow eyes. Being discovered, I drew my sword to confront him, but he merely laughed. It was the most horrible sound I’ve ever heard! Then, from the open tomb behind him, I could see the spirits of the dead gathering around him. That is when I ran here.”\nIârion was about to reply when the flames of the great fire suddenly burst into the air and then died, leaving the Rangers in total darkness. All about them, a chill fog gathered. From within the black mist they could hear scraping and rustling sounds. As their eyes adjusted to the dark, they descried the horrid outline of many ghouls in rusted armor surrounding them. The dead faces glared at them with hollow eyes, and rotted hands raised ancient blades to attack.\n“To arms, Dúnedain!” shouted Aragorn, drawing his blade. “The wraiths of Angmar are upon us!”",
        "doNotRead": "The Rangers were unprepared for an attack, and they were nearly overmastered by the sudden onslaught of Thaurdir and his ghouls. But the heroes who stood with them rallied the Dúnedain to victory with their unyielding courage.\nEven so, it was a frightful battle. Swords were not the enemy’s only weapon, and the fear of them nearly drove the heroes mad. Yet as the dawn drew closer, the sorcerer’s spells began to fade and the Rangers gained the upper hand. However, just as victory seemed assured, Thaurdir seized Iârion and fled the city. The brave Ranger was holding two enemies at bay when the sorcerer struck him over the head with a resounding blow. Then, Thaurdir ordered two of his minions to retreat with the body. From behind a press of ghastly warriors, the heroes saw Amarthiúl give chase but they were unable to aid him because of the enemies that barred their way.\nAs the first light of sun broke through the clouds, the heroes struck down the last of their unnatural foes and ran after Amarthiúl. They found him at Deadmen’s Gate; his eyes glazed in a stupor. He still wielded his sword and struck at the air around him, but there were no ghouls left to fight.\n“Amarthiúl!” cried one of the heroes, “The dawn has come, and the enemy has fled.”\nThe Dúnadan lowered his sword and regarded the heroes as one waking from a dream. “I couldn’t reach him,” he muttered as he fell to his knees. “When I saw them take Iârion, I tried to follow. But the fog grew thick around me, and I lost my way.”\n“It was an evil spell that clouded your eyes,” said one of the heroes, trying to comfort the young Ranger. “The wraith that attacked us was a powerful sorcerer. It was he that took your friend.”\n“Why?” asked Amarthiúl, but none could answer. On the ground, the young Ranger found the hawk pendant of Iârion and regarded it in his hand.\n“It matters not,” said the Dúnadan, clutching the pendant and rising to his feet. “Thaurdir has taken my friend, so I will pursue him.”\n“We will aid you in this quest,” spoke the heroes with one voice. “We cannot abandon Iârion to the same fate as those village people.”\n“Then let us depart swiftly,” said Amarthiúl,\nsheathing his weapon. “We may still rescue him if we move quickly!”",

        "flavorIntro": "The battle at Fornost was fierce and bitter, and left many of the Dúnedain wounded. The sight of the wraiths had very nearly broken their spirit, and had it not been for the valiant efforts of Iârion’s companions, the Rangers would not have withstood the attack. Once dawn had finally arrived, the Dúnedain recuperated their strength, shoring up the defenses of Deadmen’s Dike and tending to the wounded.\nAmarthiúl had other concerns. Iârion had been captured during the battle by the Wraith Thaurdir, and there was still time to come to his aid. The heroes who had helped defend Fornost vowed to rescue Iârion as well, and so their hunt began. It didn’t take long for them to find the enemy’s tracks leading northeast into the hills.\nThaurdir and the remnants of his forces, including the minions that subdued and captured Iârion, were making great haste across the North Downs. Despite the enemy’s efforts to get away, the heroes were smaller in number and eager to pursue their quarry. Iârion’s captors took little care to cover their tracks, and so the hunters spent many hours chasing afoot without stopping to rest, eat or find their bearings. They traveled far into the night, hoping to overtake Thaurdir under the cover of darkness. But when the sun rose over the green hills, they had still closed little ground on their adversary.\nAmarthiúl looked north to the horizon and sighed, worry etched upon his brow. “It’s no use. Thaurdir is a Wraith of the shadow world, and his minions care not for food or rest. They travel unhindered for weeks without feeling weariness, while we struggle to keep pace.” He turned to his companions, forlorn.\n“Patience, my friend,” one of the heroes said, clasping Amarthiúl’s shoulder. “Whether it be at sunset tonight or a fortnight from now, we will not stop pursuing them until we have rescued Iârion. They must have some need of him alive, for we have seen no sign that harm has befallen him.”\n“Indeed, although that thought worries me equally,” another of their company said. “Amarthiúl, what do you know of Iârion? What reason would Thaurdir have to take him captive? Surely Aragorn, Chieftain of the Dúnedain, would have been a greater prize.”\nThe young Ranger took Iârion’s pendant from one of the pouches he wore across his belt and stared at it remorsefully.\n“I... I am not sure,” he said, shaking his head. “Iârion comes from a noble bloodline, that I do know. This is the symbol of his house,” he explained, showing the heroes the pendant of the hawk-in-flight they’d seen Iârion wearing. “A lesser prize than Aragorn you say, and no doubt that is true. But Aragorn’s true heritage we have long kept hidden from the Enemy. Iârion’s heritage needed no such safekeeping. As long as I’ve known him, he has worn this pendant proudly.”\nThe Ranger’s eyes narrowed and he looked at the heroes with bitter vengeance deep in his thoughts. “Whatever the reason, I know what I saw at Fornost. Thaurdir could have taken many others, but left them dead or wounded instead. When Iârion challenged him, he sent his minions one at a time, sacrificing them to Iârion’s blade in order to wear him down. He meant to capture Iârion alive. Perhaps that was his goal all along.” The rest of the company nodded in response to Amarthiúl.\n“All the more reason why we must pace ourselves,” one of the heroes said. “We are no help to Iârion falling over with exhaustion. We must be ready to fight when we reach the Wraith. Let us press on!”\nThey continued to track their quarry for many miles, keeping a more sustainable pace, resting briefly when necessary and pressing onward with haste when the enemy’s tracks led them downhill or through level country. Eventually they reached the edge of the North Downs, where the green hills gave way to the vast and desolate lands of northern Eriador. The weather grew colder and fouler the further north they traveled. Snow and freezing rain began to pelt their cloaks and hoods, and for the first time since departing Fornost, they felt the need to camp for the night.\nThat was the first night they heard the howling. It came from all around them, growing louder with each passing minute. One of the heroes took charge and alerted the rest of the company. “We cannot tarry. The wolves here are evil and vicious, and the darkness of night is their hunting ground.”\nThey quickly broke camp, the weight of weariness beginning to take its toll. Throughout the night, the incessant baying of wolves was ever at their heels. Amarthiúl gave voice to their common concern: “I fear our hunt has just become theirs...”",
        "doNotRead": "They had endured the freezing cold and the biting fangs of evil wolves for many days, traveling as far as they could by day and fending off fierce attacks each night, but over time the company had grown weary. Defeating the pack’s leader had caused the creatures to retreat, but spending restless nights chased and harassed by wolves had forced them far off track, close to the peak of Mount Gram which towered into the northern clouds. They were far from Thaurdir and their friend Iârion, with no way to tell how much time had been lost fighting the evil wolves. Worse, they were far too exhausted to continue marching without sleep, and many of them had grown sick from the cold. What little game there was to hunt in the wastes had been scared off by the wolves, and the rations from Fornost were running out.\nAfter many days of these conditions, a night with no howling was a great relief. The company discussed at length whether this meant it was safe to camp for the night, but in the end, they were too hungry and weak to continue. Knowing they were in a dangerous position, they had no choice but to stop for the night.\nThat was when the Goblins struck. They emerged under the cover of darkness, clad in white fur that blended with the snow. The sentries that kept watch were taken from behind, pulled to the ground and gagged. One spotted the approaching Goblins and called out, but was immediately struck by Goblin-arrows. The sentry’s shouts woke the rest of the company, but taken by surprise and outnumbered nearly ten to one, the odds were grim. The largest of the Goblins stepped forward and grinned wickedly. “Surround them! Don’t let any escape!” it bellowed, “Gornákh wants them alive!”\nThe ensuing battle was futile. The heroes fought valiantly, but the heavy snow impeded their movement and the Goblins had a strong upper hand. Most of the company was knocked unconscious or cornered and surrounded. Others fought to the bitter end, though the Goblins seemed to be trying to take as many captives as possible. Those who resisted and could not be captured were pierced with stone arrowheads or spear-tips, and left to bleed in the snow.\nThe heroes were forced to submit, disarmed of their weapons, and bound. They looked amongst themselves for a moment before they realized that Amarthiúl was no longer standing among them. They weren’t sure if his body was among the slain.\n“Come along now, lads,” the larger Goblin growled, pulling one of the heroes to his feet and forcing him to march at spear-point. “Mount Gram awaits.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Blindfolded, the company was marched into the tunnels of Mount Gram. It seemed they walked for miles uphill, and through many winding corridors. When the blindfolds were removed, they were deep in the heart of the Goblin stronghold, with no knowledge of an escape route.\nGornákh’s dungeons were gruesome and awful. They smelled of rot and decay, and the floor was damp, covered in frost and slime. Flickering torchlight scarcely illuminated the dungeon’s halls. The Goblins separated the companions and brought them down different tunnels, passing by chambers filled with wicked instruments. Cries of lament and pain echoed throughout the dungeons, making their hearts sink with dread.\nThe companions were thrown into separate prison cells, all windowless and scaled with frost. Some were dragged to cells close to the dungeon’s entrance, and others were brought much further into the belly of the dungeons. Each was alone. Any attempt on their part to call out to their companions was met with a swift beating.\nOne by one, they were brought to the chamber of Gornákh, who interrogated them cruelly at the edge of a knife or whip, adding to their scars and their misery whenever they gave an unsatisfactory answer. Even so, none would dare betray their companions or their mission, and spoke nothing other than witty retorts or curses under their breath.\nOn rare occasions, they were offered a repulsive meat of unknown origin that smelled of death, and likely tasted just as bad, though none of them dared to eat it. After prolonged starvation, however, even this foul meat was starting to look tempting. Having lost track of time in the never-ending darkness of the dungeon, they started to wonder if there was any hope of escape. A seed of despair took root and began to grow.\nFinally, the monotony was broken when one of the company’s heroes overheard what sounded like a regiment of Orcs arriving in the dungeons. “Gornákh!” a familiar voice bellowed, his voice echoing throughout the halls. “We have come to claim your prisoners in the name of Daechanar!” The hero stood in their cell and leaned against the cold bars, trying to see past the darkness. There could be no mistaking that voice, warped and tinged with evil. It was Thaurdir, the Wraith they had confronted in Fornost. The one who had taken their friend.\n“But, we are the ones who captured them! They are our prizes, not yours... And I am not yet done playing with them!” Gornákh protested, angry with Thaurdir’s presence.\nThe voice of Thaurdir was cold and imposing. “Remember to whom you speak,” he responded. “Lord Daechanar has claimed these for his own. Bring them to Carn Dûm at once. They will make fine soldiers for the Lord of Angmar.” There was a long, sinister pause. “Or do I have to remind you what Lord Daechanar does to those who do not obey?”\nThe hero clenched their hand over the bars of their cell, surprised at the mention of a Lord of Angmar. The argument between Thaurdir and Gornákh grew heated. Several of Gornákh’s guards ran out of the hall, presumably heading to where the argument was taking place. The hero shuddered to think of what fate might befall the Goblin who defied Thaurdir—or worse, the fate that awaited the hero’s companions. Just then, a faint light crawled across the walls, and the lightest of footsteps approached the cell. The shape of a hooded man appeared, illuminated dimly by the light of a torch. The hero drew away from the bars cautiously.\n“Don’t fret,” the man whispered, and Amarthiúl pulled down the hood that covered his face. He raised a keyring and unlocked the door to the cell, and a wave of relief washed over the prisoner.\n“Amarthiúl! You came back for us!” the hero whispered, exiting the cell and embracing the Ranger.\n“Of course. After the battle with the Goblins, I escaped and managed to track everyone to this mountain. I couldn’t find a way in at first, but when Thaurdir and his Orcs arrived, I slipped in behind them. Once the jailor was distracted, I made my way to your cell. The way I came is now guarded by Orcs from the north. However, there is a another exit, a hidden gate high in the southern end of the mountain. I overheard one of the Goblins talking about it.”\n“Good,” the hero replied. “We’ll find as many of the others as we can and make our way to this southern gate.”\nAmarthiúl hesitated for a moment, and clenched his jaw. “If Thaurdir is here, that means that Iârion is here as well. He must mean to bring us all north to Carn Dûm, together.”\nHe handed his keyring to the hero, closing his companion’s hand around it. “There are many more of our company imprisoned here. Find them and make your way to the southern gate. I will try to find Iârion, and meet you there.” The hero nodded, and the two clasped forearms. With that, the Ranger quietly headed back the way he came.\nThe newfound sense of freedom gave way to anxious dread.\nThe halls were quieter than ever before. Alone and without weapons or gear, the task ahead was daunting. Even so, the rest of the company could not be abandoned. The hero steeled their resolve and went to work...",
        "doNotRead": "In hindsight, the dank cold of the dungeon was tranquil in comparison to the icy weather outside. The narrow pass twisting down the snowy mountainside was slippery and treacherous, and one false step could spell doom. After cautiously making their way down the pass for hours, they reached the base of the mountain, hid in the treetops, and waited.\nIt wasn’t long before Amarthiúl descended down the narrow pass and the company was reunited at last. Iârion was not with him. “Thaurdir is aware of our escape,” the Ranger said grimly once they had said their greetings and taken stock of their numbers. “Our fortunes have turned. Now we are the ones being pursued.”\n“And what of Iârion?” another of their company asked, to which Amarthiúl’s response was solemn silence.\n“I tried to reach him,” he explained after a long pause. “He was held captive by the Orcs who came with Thaurdir. He was unconscious, but unharmed. I slew many of the Orcs, but that awful Wraith appeared and fought me back. He ordered that the Orcs take him to Carn Dûm, and held me at bay while they escaped.”\nAmarthiúl cursed and slammed his bloody fist against a nearby tree, furious and desperate. “I was beaten again. I barely made it out alive. And worse, Thaurdir is hot on our trail. I fear I’ve only made things worse.”\n“You rescued us from torture and death, or worse,” one of the heroes replied, comforting their friend. “For now we must regroup and get away from this awful place. I fear we cannot pursue Iârion’s captors north, not in our current state.”\n“Are we to abandon our mission, then? To abandon Iârion?” Amarthiúl asked. “No, we cannot. We must make haste towards Carn Dûm, to catch up with the Orcs and rescue him!”\n“I understand how you feel,” another one of the companions assured Amarthiúl, “but are we, alone and weary from our imprisonment, to confront all the forces of Angmar in their bastion of Carn Dûm?”\nAmarthiúl opened his mouth to respond, but he knew they were right. Most of them were wounded, and some hadn’t eaten in days. Their clothing was torn, their rations long gone, and they had little of the equipment they’d brought with them from Fornost. “You’re right,” he said at last, sorrowful. “What, then? Have we failed in our quest?”\n“No,” the hero said with a smile. “Not yet. Not while there is hope. We know they desire Iârion alive, for whatever ill purpose. We have no choice but to head south, to Rivendell, to seek the counsel of Elrond and gather our strength.” He clasped his hand on Amarthiúl’s shoulder. “Perhaps then we can assault Carn Dûm to rescue Iârion. But there are many miles between here and Rivendell, and Thaurdir still pursues us. One step at a time, brother.” Amarthiúl nodded, and the company set off to the south.",

        "flavorIntro": "The company had barely escaped from the dungeons of Mount Gram with their lives, thanks to the bravery of the Ranger Amarthiúl and the skill and guile of the heroes who rescued their companions. Heading south from Mount Gram, they found the return to Rivendell fraught with peril at every turn. The need for haste forced the company to travel into the wild lands of the Ettenmoors, a decision they quickly regretted.\nThe Ettenmoors were an untamed and dreary land, overrun with Trolls and beasts that roamed the wilds, constantly searching for food. The heroes had recovered some of their belongings in the dungeons, but were exhausted from their imprisonment and in bad shape to be fighting such monsters.\nThe rolling hills were beset with horrid weather. The skies did not clear for even a moment, a torrent of rain constantly pelting their cloaks. The rain muddied the ground, soaked their clothes and chilled their bones. The clouds overhead were obsidian. At night, they blotted out the moon and the stars, and the occasional flash of lightning was the only light to guide them. Now and again, a roar of thunder crashed around them, setting their ears to ring.\nThere was little food to be found in the hills of the Troll-fells, and even less shelter. If they could find a haven - a small cave to hide in, or a patch of trees to give them cover - they could take a brief rest, safe from the Trolls and the rain. However, they would soon be forced to move again, for they would have to keep a steady pace to make it to Rivendell in time to help Iârion. At least, that was the reason they gave for their haste. They knew the Wraith Thaurdir was pursuing them still, and the thought of him catching up to them in this dreadful place brought terror to their hearts...",
        "doNotRead": "The journey through the Ettenmoors was full of hardship and turmoil, but the company was able to persevere through the wilds. They had endured the cold and evaded Trolls–and worse–at every turn. When they scaled the last hill and saw the woods of Rhudaur before them, they breathed sighs of relief and rejoiced for the first time since escaping the Goblin dungeons.\n“This is the land of Rhudaur, one of the three kingdoms of old Arnor,” Amarthiúl explained as they entered the pine woods. “The line of Isildur did not survive in Rhudaur, and over time the number of Dúnedain here dwindled. The elders tell us that evil men, hillmen in league with the realm of Angmar, usurped the last king of Rhudaur many hundreds of years ago. From that moment on Rhudaur was a vassal of the Witch-king, and those Dúnedain still remaining in this land were either slain in cold blood, or fled west.”\n“You are well-schooled in the history of your people,” one of the heroes said in amazement.\nAmarthiúl smiled. “It is important that we Dúnedain remember who we are and where we come from,” he replied. “Our kingdom was divided and our people were scattered in the long war with Angmar, and not many of us remain. But we believe there will come a time when the blood of Isildur can reunite the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. If we forget our heritage, we lose our purpose.”\nOnce they felt that they had traveled far enough from the Troll-fells that they could safely rest, the company set up camp, hunted game and cooked a fresh meal for the first time in weeks. But they could not linger for long. Their destination was still many miles to the southeast, and they felt a cold chill following them into Rhudaur, as though tendrils of dread had crawled after them through the moorland...",

        "flavorIntro": "Having escaped imprisonment in the Goblin dungeons of Mount Gram and an icy death in the rugged Coldfells at the hands of hungry Trolls, the heroes had finally reached the woods of Rhudaur. The company made good time for several days, fair weather and plentiful food motivating them to travel at a brisk pace. Yet, no matter how many leagues they crossed, the dark presence and fear that had been tugging at the back of their minds ever since escaping Mount Gram never ceased to haunt them. When they slept, they were plagued by dreadful nightmares, and every waking moment was filled with the sensation of being pursued.\nAs they traveled, evidence of the kingdom’s collapse peppered the woods. They crossed through ancient ruins and made their way around towers of stone and rubble, long forgotten and ravaged by years of disrepair. “This area has been largely uninhabited for centuries,” Amarthiúl explained to them. “Once Rhudaur was annexed by the Witch-king, those loyal to him were called to fight in his long war with Arthedain. The kingdom of Rhudaur was abolished and left to ruin.”\n“They should have you teaching young pupils,” one of the companions said with a chuckle, and Amarthiúl himself gave a smirk.\n“Perhaps, but this is the path I chose for myself,” Amarthiúl disclosed. His expression grew solemn. “When I was younger, I followed Iârion and several other Rangers on a hunting expedition. I was eager to prove myself to the others, that I could be one of them. But I was too brash and foolish, and the orcs captured me. Iârion risked his life to save me. His determination, his willingness to sacrifice everything, inspired me to become more than a scholar or a healer. I swore that I would repay my life debt with steel and blood. I wanted to become a warrior and a leader like him, to save others like he saved me.”\nThe Ranger gave a sigh and rubbed his forehead, worried. “Now he is the one held captive, tortured or worse, and I am powerless to help.”\nAmarthiúl appeared inconsolable. It had been tough watching the young Ranger’s determination go unrewarded for so long. “I understand now why you are so driven to find him,” one of the heroes said. “Do not lose hope. We are not defeated yet.”\nJust then, the young Ranger’s gaze was drawn behind the heroes, deeper into the woods, and his eyes widened. “Is that what I think it is?” he muttered, and ran ahead. They hadn’t seen Amarthiúl run that swiftly since departing from Fornost. It didn’t take long to catch up to the Ranger - the building he had seen lay fifty meters away, obscured by trees and brush. The pinewood forest opened into a small clearing, concealed on all sides by dense overgrowth. At the other end of the clearing, they saw a stone gatehouse, decrepit from years of disrepair, forgotten by time, but standing strong nevertheless. Behind the gatehouse stood the ruins of an ancient keep tucked into the woods. They had seen several such ruins throughout their journey, but what caught their eyes was the symbol painted upon the wooden door of the gate. It was the symbol of the regal hawk-in-flight. Amarthiúl pulled Iârion’s pendant from underneath his tunic, where he wore it on a thin chain.\n“This symbol... It’s the same!” he exclaimed, holding the pendant up next to the symbol on the door.\n“You said Iârion wore this pendant proudly as a symbol of his lineage,” one of the heroes said, and the company exchanged anxious glances. “This is a fortuitous discovery. We have not the slightest clue why Thaurdir - and this Daechanar who commands him - took Iârion captive at Fornost. If Amarthiúl is right and the Wraith was after Iârion in particular, these ruins might hold the answer to this mystery.”\nThere was a murmur of agreement, and Amarthiúl nodded. “Then what are we waiting for?” he declared, an eager light in his eyes. But as soon as they opened the door to the gatehouse, a furious gale, chill as ice, knocked them to the ground. The wind shrieked. There was a foulness in the air all around them - in the ruins, and in the woods behind them. Something evil haunted Iârion’s ancestral home, and worse, the malevolence that had followed them from Mount Gram was close behind...",
        "doNotRead": "The company’s investigation of the ruins was fruitful, but dangerous. Iârion’s ancestral keep was haunted by the wights of Dúnedain who had sided with Angmar, and the spirits of those they had slain in their wicked pact. It seemed that few Dúnedain had managed to escape from this place alive, just as the heroes were barely able to escape with their lives.\nOnce they had reached a reasonable distance, they began to piece together what they had found inside the keep as they walked at a brisk pace. Most of the ancient documents they found were too tattered and faded to read, but some were still legible. Among them was a family tree, inscribed inside a leather tome bearing the hawk crest they had become familiar with - the crest of Iârion’s family.\n“Look!” the hero holding the tome shouted, pointing to the tree. “I recognize this name: Daechanar. That is the same name as the one who commands Thaurdir – the ‘lord of Angmar’ mentioned in the Goblin dungeons!”\nOne of the companions shook her head, pondering what they had learned. “It cannot be the same person. It’s been many centuries. The Dúnedain are long-lived, but they are not immortal. The Daechanar in this family tree should be long dead by now...”\nThey pondered that thought for some time, but they were too weary from their hardships to come to any conclusions. While they were starting to understand the events that had unfolded in Arnor many hundreds of years ago, there were too many pieces of the puzzle still missing.\n“We should continue to Rivendell,” one of the heroes declared at last. “Even Thaurdir cannot pursue us there, and we can consult Elrond about these matters. If there is anyone who will understand what we are dealing with, it is he.”\nThere was a murmur of agreement, and the company continued traveling with great haste. The ghostly presence of Thaurdir hung over them still, an ominous stormcloud threatening to overtake them if they dwelled any longer...",

        "flavorIntro": "The leaves had fallen and winter’s cold bite had crept ever southward by the time the heroes’ company reached Rivendell. They were greeted by Elven guards who recognized the heroes and welcomed them, escorting the company into The Last Homely House and offering them food and drink, which they accepted heartily. When they asked to see Elrond, they were granted a swift audience and brought into Elrond’s Hall.\nThe Elf-lord entered soon after, bidding the heroes to sit and tell their tale. The company spoke at length with Elrond about their long journey - their discovery at Amon Forn, the attack on Fornost, their imprisonment in Mount Gram, and the information they found in the ruins of Rhudaur.\nWhen they mentioned the name Daechanar and showed Elrond the tome they had found in the home of Iârion’s ancestors, his eyes narrowed with recognition and his jaw clenched. “That is a name I have not heard spoken in over a thousand years,” he said. “The Daechanar you speak of was once a Dúnedain of Rhudaur. It is he who paved the way for the kingdom’s collapse, defecting to the side of Angmar and joining the Witch-king as one of his trusted lieutenants. His brother Iârchon and his sons were among the few Dúnedain who managed to escape, fleeing here to Imladris to dwell for a time.”\nElrond knew of what he spoke by memory. He had lived through these events, and not read of them in a book. “Not long after, the forces of Angmar laid siege to Rivendell. We were beset by our enemies for some time, but after many seasons we broke the siege. Iârchon was among those who fought to defend Imladris. I watched as he met his traitorous brother on the fields of battle. Daechanar was slain and the battle was won, but Iârchon was disturbed by his brother’s last words and came to me seeking counsel. I still remember those words, to this day: ‘I will outlive all of you and haunt your descendants long after you are dead. My master has seen to that.’ I feared that the lord of the Nazgûl had taught some manner of foul sorcery to his lieutenant, that which knits dead flesh and traps spirits long-deceased within this realm.”\nAmarthiúl’s eyes went wide with fear and realization, and he rose to his feet. “Do you mean to tell us that the Daechanar who commands the dead we have encountered is this same Daechanar, who died so long ago?”\n“Just so,” Elrond replied, and bid the young Ranger to sit once more. “Only I believe he was never truly defeated - his body was broken, but his spirit remained. ‘I will haunt your descendants long after you are dead.’ You say that Iârion was captured alive at Fornost, and I do not believe this to be coincidence.” He paused for a long moment, considering what he had heard.\n“Iârion is of Daechanar’s blood. I believe he means to possess Iârion, to use as his new body. Then, his return to this world will be complete. With the Witch-king in Minas Morgul, Daechanar would rule over the dark land of Angmar - you’ve already seen orcs at his command and the Goblins of Mount Gram in his allegiance. The safety of the north would be shattered.” It seemed difficult to believe, but the wisdom of Elrond did not lie, and the heroes did not doubt for a moment the truth behind his words. Finally, everything they had experienced made sense.\n“Iârion has been captive for weeks,” one of the heroes said mournfully, hoping all was not lost. “Are we too late to stop Daechanar’s plan from coming to fruition?”\nAmarthiúl clenched the pendant of the hawk-in-flight which hung from his neck, and spoke passionately. “We must head north immediately!”\nElrond spoke calmly despite the dire situation, raising his palm to the Ranger. “Your bravery is admirable, young Ranger, but have patience. A powerful ritual such as this is not something easily cobbled together. It is no coincidence that Thaurdir and his forces attacked when they did. In several weeks, midwinter will be upon us. It is the coldest and darkest day of the year’s cycle, the last day before life begins to spring anew. On midwinter’s night, Daechanar will find his passage into Iârion’s body easiest. If I am correct, he is biding his time and waiting for the right moment. That means we have time to gather our strength, and for you to rest. You must be weary from your long journey.”\nThe Elf-lord then called several Elves into the hall, and tasked them with traveling south and west to find as many Rangers as they could and summon them to Imladris. “I do not have a host of Elves to send into battle, but those I can spare will accompany you north, to the fortress of Carn Dûm.”\nThe heroes looked at one another and nodded, confirming their intentions and rising to their feet. One of them gave Elrond a short bow and addressed him politely. “Daechanar must be stopped. We shall venture north as well, and see this mission to its end.”\nAmarthiúl turned to the heroes, his expression full of stern determination. “My friends, time and time again you have put your life on the line for my kin. Please, allow me to join you. Wherever your travels lead you, my swords shall be yours if you give me leave to assist.”\n“You have earned your place among us,” one of the heroes said, clasping Amarthiúl’s forearm. “We are grateful to have you fighting by our side.”\nFor over a fortnight the company rested well in Rivendell, recovering from their wounds and exhaustion. Each day more Rangers responded to Elrond’s call, arriving in Imladris with bow and sword, eager to seek vengeance for their brethren who fell in Fornost. They waited as long as they could to prepare for the assault, but they were soon out of time and could tarry no longer if they wished to reach Carn Dûm before the winter solstice. With a small but determined band of Elves and Rangers at their side, their only hope was to fight their way into the fortress so they could stop Daechanar’s ritual...",
        "doNotRead": "As they slew Thaurdir, his remains crumbled and decayed into ash before their very eyes, and his armor and weapon clattered to the ground harmlessly. But before they could rejoice in their victory, the howling of wolves sounded in the air, as if all around them.\n“Goblins!” One of the Rangers in the rear ranks shouted, “Goblins from Mount Gram!” The company found themselves assaulted from the south by Goblins while the Orcs of Carn Dûm rallied their defenses once more. They had but a moment to slip into the fortress before they were surrounded on all sides.\nOne of the Elves that had accompanied them from Rivendell turned to the heroes with a grim expression and shouted over the clamour of battle, “You must make your way into the fortress and stop Daechanar’s ritual!”\n“What about you?” One of the heroes replied, worried. “You cannot hold off these Goblins forever!”\n“Then do not take forever! Now go!” he beseeched the heroes again before joining the fray. The heroes had no choice but to leave the rest of their party to fend off the Goblins, slipping through the gates of Carn Dûm. They slew the few Orcs that remained in their way, and infiltrated the enemy’s stronghold to confront Daechanar and rescue their friend...",

        "flavorIntro": "The capital of Angmar was a terrifying place. Once the heroes had defeated the Orcs guarding the entrance and made their way inside, all was eerily quiet in comparison to the battle raging outside. The halls of Carn Dûm were cold and lonesome, though no matter where the heroes ventured within its walls, the feeling that they were being watched never ceased. The realm of Angmar had claimed immeasurable lives over many hundreds of years in its long war with the Dúnedain. With each step they took, their burden grew worse.\nThe fortress was sprawling, but if they strained their senses, they heard cries of pain coming from below. So, deeper into the stronghold they ventured, down many long and steep flights of stairs, the corridors becoming narrower, the stone walls pressing in all around them.\nSomewhere within these catacombs, surrounded by the watchful dead, their friend Iârion was struggling in torment. Spurred onward by steel resolve, the heroes began their search...",
        "doNotRead": "The heroes had but seconds to spare as the catacombs crumbled and collapsed around them. They ran as fast as they could, trying to remember the route they took through Carn Dûm’s dark and labyrinthine halls. The walls shook and screeched as a dark power coursed through them. Walking corpses collapsed and decayed, foul spirits dispersed, and the power that Daechanar had summoned began to crumble with his defeat.\nThe dark clouds above the fortress scattered, and the light of day washed over the battlefield. With the defeat of their master and the sun glaring down at them, the Goblins fled south to their mountain refuge. The remaining Elves and Rangers, rallied by the turning tide, drove the Orcs into a full rout. The battle was won... but the victory was bittersweet. As the heroes emerged from the fortress carrying Iârion’s body, their company was filled with a great sorrow. Though they were able to defeat Daechanar and stop his plans from coming to fruition, they were too late to save their friend. The tragedy of slaying the Ranger with their own hand was something the heroes would never forget, although they had his final words to comfort them.\nThe return trip was melancholy, but swift. Although winter had come to the north in full force, the deadly, unnatural weather they had become familiar with seemed to subside with the fall of Daechanar, and the evils of Angmar no longer dared to emerge and stand in the heroes’ way. Once they had put the peak of Mount Gram behind them, the Elves decided to part ways, heading back to Rivendell. The heroes thanked them for their aid, and in return the Elves told them they were welcome to return to Imladris once their business with the Dúnedain was finished. The rest of the company continued west to Fornost, to lay to rest their fallen comrades.\nThe Rangers and the heroes buried the dead in a tomb dedicated to those who fell in defense of the North, and gathered together to speak words in memory of their valiant sacrifice. After everyone but the heroes and Amarthiúl had left, the young Ranger approached Iârion’s sepulcher, holding the pendant of the hawk-in-flight. “I was not able to save him,” he said as the heroes approached. The death of Amarthiúl’s mentor weighed heavily upon his heart.\n“None of us were,” one of the heroes replied, mournfully. “But had you not been determined to pursue Thaurdir and rescue your friend, who knows what horrors Daechanar would have unleashed upon the lands your kin protect?”\nThe Ranger nodded, clutching the pendant tighter. “He had no siblings or heirs. The line of Iârchon and Daechanar is ended.” With that, Amarthiúl stepped forward to place Iârion’s pendant atop his tomb. Letting go of Iârion’s pendant seemed to be a difficult act. As he lay the pendant on the tomb of his friend, he calmly sang:\nA fearless man in darkest night\nA faithful brother bright with mirth;\nHis spirit now is taken flight\nBeyond the circles of the earth.\nOne of the heroes rested a hand on Amarthiúl’s shoulder. The Ranger had come a long way and had grown much during their journey. “Iârion was a noble warrior. He would be proud to see how strong you’ve become.”\nThey lingered for some time, grieving their loss, before they finally emerged from the quiet tombs of Fornost. “What will you do now?”\n“I pledged my swords to you, remember?” Amarthiúl said with a warm smile. “The Dúnedain are in your debt. I aim to repay that debt. If you ever need my assistance, do not hesitate to call upon me.” With those words of friendship, they parted ways. The heroes traveled back to Rivendell and spent the rest of winter under the care of the Elves, recovering from their many journeys and battles. Before the snows thawed, however, a messenger came for them bearing a scroll with a peculiar seal.\nIt seems the heroes were needed once again. Fully rested and ready for adventure, they thanked Elrond for his hospitality and ventured back into the wild, riding as fast as they could to the west... toward the Grey Havens.",

        "flavorIntro": "The road west to the Grey Havens was as peaceful and uneventful as the company of adventurers could have hoped. The horrors they faced in the dread realm were far behind them, and with spring blooming, they were free to enjoy their travels for the first time in what seemed like ages. It wasn’t long before they passed the Tower Hills, and arrived at the gates of the Havens.\nThey were greeted warmly by Círdan the Shipwright, the Master of the Grey Havens, leading a group of Elves. “Thank you for all responding to my letter so quickly. Allow me to welcome you to Mithlond, the last port of the Elves east of the great sea of Belegaer,” he said to the heroes with a smile. The wisdom of ages past shone in Círdan’s eyes. “Follow me, and I shall bring you to our meeting chambers. There, you shall discover the reason why you have traveled many leagues from Rivendell.”\nEager to assist in whatever manner they could, the company followed the Elves through the gates and were escorted to a tall white tower overlooking the Gulf of Lune. Elegant Elven ships were docked in the harbors, tall and white with the star of Eärendil shining upon their sails. They were as much works of art as they were sailing vessels, beautiful examples of the exceptional craftsmanship of the Elves. Strangely, there were also two Gondorian vessels docked in the port, the White Tree of Gondor emblazoned upon their sails.\nThe tower’s circular meeting chamber was beautifully decorated. Open arched windows facing the west allowed for a steady breeze of sea-wind that kept the company cool as they waited. Soon after their arrival, a wiry middle-aged man entered the room. He had long black hair, a thinning beard, and high cheekbones. “This is Lord Calphon of Dol Amroth,” Círdan introduced the man, “and he has come a long way by sea to seek our assistance.” Lord Calphon stood and smiled, shaking their hands one by one. His eyes were equal parts relief and worry.\n“It would be easier if I started at the beginning,” Calphon explained as he sat down at the table, worriedly fidgeting with his clasped hands. Círdan made a gesture to the nobleman as if to give him the floor, and Calphon told his tale. “It started but a few months ago: I had a peculiar dream, the most vivid dream I’ve ever had. In this dream, I saw a beautiful island in the wide ocean, and I longed with all my heart to go there. I saw ruins of ancient Númenor that sprawled across the island, reaching even deeper below the waves. The moment I awoke, I knew that it was not a simple dream. But that was not the only dream I had.\n“I continued to dream of the island and its secrets for months. To this very day, I have visions of its temples and ruins. I did not believe the island could exist, because we in Gondor are taught that Númenor sank beneath the ocean in its entirety. I’d heard of the wisdom and foresight of the Elf-lord Círdan, and thought that if any should know of the great ocean of Belegaer, it would be the Elves who sail its seas. So I took my ship, the Dawn Star, the formidable Duskbringer, and the fastest ship from the fleet of Dol Amroth, the Silver Wing, and ventured here in the hope Círdan could lend his wisdom.” He nodded to Círdan, who turned to address the heroes.\n“I have been assisting Calphon in interpreting his dreams, and have come to the conclusion that the island in his visions is but a sunken peak of Númenor. That land indeed drowned beneath the waves when the Valar unleashed their wrath upon the Númenoreans. But I believe its highest peaks may have survived its Downfall. It cannot be coincidence that Calphon, one of Númenorean blood, dreams of his ancient homeland.”\nThe heroes listened to Calphon’s story and the wisdom of Círdan with great interest. Once Círdan had finished speaking, one of the heroes stood and politely asked, “Even knowing of the island’s origin, finding it in the open ocean would be quite an undertaking. Of what assistance can we be on this venture?”\nCírdan walked to the chamber’s open windows and looked out to the Gulf of Lune and the harbor of Mithlond. “This will be a long journey, and while I cannot see what dangers Calphon should face, I sense that great peril follows in his wake. I have not the power to command you, but should you desire to assist, I would ask that you sail with him and help him reach the island from his visions. I sense the utmost importance in this quest.”\nThe heroes looked among themselves for a time, but there was no argument or debate. The urgency in Círdan’s voice and his fabled foresight were all the heroes needed. They nodded to one another in agreement. “We shall accompany Lord Calphon on his voyage,” one of the heroes stepped forward and spoke. “But, we have not a vessel of our own.”\nCírdan smiled and his eyes shone bright, as though he knew the heroes would accept. He bid the heroes follow him, and exited the chambers with eager steps, the company following close behind. They accompanied the Shipwright down many flights and through white archways, until they came at last to the docks of the Havens. Sunlight danced on the water’s surface, and seagulls sang over the Lune. “Behold!” said Círdan, motioning to the nearest dock.\nA beautiful Elven ship lay anchored in port. It was white, with folded wings on its sides, and on its prow was carved a majestic swan. “I envisioned this vessel long before Calphon reached out to us,” the Elf-lord said, placing his hand upon the side of the ship with care. “It was built for a voyage of paramount importance, but has never yet left the Gulf of Lune. I believe this is the journey for which it was built. From here on, this ship shall be known as Oloroitarë, the ‘Dream-chaser.’ I give this ship and its crew to you, the champions of Gandalf and Elrond, to keep you safe in your journey. There are two other vessels docked in this port, the Glórinaith and the Nárelenya, which you may also find useful, should you need them. These ships, and those of Lord Calphon, shall be your fleet.”\nThe Dream-chaser’s strength and beauty were second to none. The heroes thanked Círdan with all their hearts, humbled by the greatness of the Shipwright’s gifts. “We shall not fail in our quest,” spoke one of the heroes, bowing low. “Nor shall we fail to keep safe the gifts of the Havens.”\n“I do not doubt it,” Círdan replied, smiling. And with that, preparations were made for their long voyage...",
        "doNotRead": "“I don’t see any more of them,” one of the heroes shouted, looking out over the great sea for any sign of black sails. The Corsairs had pursued them across many leagues of ocean. To see the horizon with no signs of the enemy was a great relief to the heroes, and to the crew.\n“I don’t understand,” Calphon said quietly. “Gondor is a hated enemy of the Corsairs of Umbar, ‘tis true. But why would these Corsairs pursue us for so long, and so far?”\n“I’m more concerned with the fact that they were so far north to begin with,” the hero chimed in. “We were only several days out from the Havens when we first spotted them. It can’t be a coincidence. They must have followed your ships from Dol Amroth.”\nCalphon’s eyes widened, and he was stricken with concern. “What? But, I hadn’t seen any signs of them in my voyage north...” He gripped the ropes of the ship tightly, his knuckles turning white. “... It pains me greatly to think that my actions may have put the Elves of the Havens in danger. I hope that Círdan will forgive me.”\nThe hero comforted Calphon with a smile. “Don’t worry. All this confirms is that our journey is not in vain. The Corsairs must have pursued us this far for a reason. Our aim should be to discover that reason. Let us find the island from your dream, and see for ourselves what secrets it holds.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The sky was bathed in a beautiful sunrise, the bright orange sun rising over the peak of the mountain just as Calphon had described. “Land ho!” a sailor shouted, and the fleet buzzed with activity. The island was large, dominated in its center by the peak of what must have once been a tall mountain. Deep in the island’s dense jungle were broken towers and ancient ruins.\n“So, it does exist,” Calphon whispered as he reached the bow of the ship, looking out to the island with great relief. “I’m glad I did not lead us to the middle of the Belegaer for naught.” The heroes shared Calphon’s relief, but had always suspected the island was real, as the wise Círdan would otherwise not have sent them on such a dangerous voyage. The ships were anchored off the western coast of the island, and the crews lowered small canoes onto the surface of the ocean. The company prepared to disembark and make their way to the shore, arming themselves in case the island proved dangerous, and making sure to take enough rations for several days.\n“You should stay here,” one of the heroes told Calphon as they prepared to leave. “You’ve done your part in helping us find the island. Now is the time for us to do ours.” Calphon shook his head and refused, determined.\n“No, I must go with you,” he explained. “I may not be able to lead us once we are on the island, but I’ve spent the better part of a year envisioning this day. I need to set foot upon that shore and see the ruins of Númenor for myself.”\nThe heroes looked amongst themselves with worry, but none could bring themselves to refuse Calphon’s request. “We know not what secrets or dangers the island may hold,” one of them said. “But if this be your will, we shall honor it and protect you.” Calphon nodded without deliberation.\nThe company boarded the smaller vessels and set forth, rowing in the direction of the uncharted shore.",
        "doNotRead": "Exploring the uncharted island was exhausting, but it was the onslaught of the faithless undead that made the company’s travels truly perilous. Making their way deeper and deeper into the island, they’d finally come to a building of note – an imposing shrine, tucked into the side of the mountain.\nAs soon as they crossed the threshold of the shrine, they felt the presence of something dark and evil. Tapestries and statues, faded and ruined from years of disrepair, depicted the evil Morgoth as a great and powerful being. “We in Gondor know the tale of Númenor’s glory and downfall; that in the dark days before Númenor’s destruction, many faithless Númenoreans worshipped Morgoth,” Lord Calphon explained, examining one of the foreboding statues. “This must have been one of the temples erected in his worship.”\nThey searched the shrine extensively, but ultimately it proved fruitless. With many questions unanswered, the company began to lose hope that the shrine was their true destination. Wishing to continue their exploration of the island, they began to leave, but Calphon insisted they stay. “Wait! We mustn’t go yet... I... I remember this place, I think...” He ran his hand along the far wall, as if attempting to remember the secrets the stones themselves held. “I remember... The sound of a hammer upon the anvil... The heat of the forge...”\nThe company looked amongst one another with concern, approaching Calphon cautiously. The nobleman’s eyes were closed as he placed his ear upon the wall, listening closely. “Lord Calphon?” one of the heroes said after a moment, placing a reassuring hand on Calphon’s shoulder. The nobleman startled as though waking from a dream, and he turned towards the heroes with a shocked expression. “There’s something here!” he exclaimed. He walked several paces to another section of the wall and placed his hand on the stones.\nTo the company’s surprise, the stones gave way, and the wall opened outwards as if upon invisible hinges, a door leading into a hidden passageway. Wide-eyed and wordless, Calphon entered the passage, the heroes close behind. The corridor was narrow and dank. They soon found themselves descending a flight of steep stairs, deeper into the darkness of the temple. Finally, after many steps, they came to a small chamber with a raised altar in its center. Two candelabras stood on either side of the altar, ancient and unlit. On the altar lay a large key of black iron.\n“A key?” Calphon said, taking the key in his hands, a puzzled expression upon his face. “I don’t understand. I sought the answer to this mystery, but all we have found on this island is another riddle.”\n“Perhaps the Elves of the Havens will have the answer,” one of the heroes suggested. With no sign of a matching lock anywhere on the island, the company made their way west, to the coast.",

        "flavorIntro": "The voyage back to the Grey Havens was long, but not nearly as perilous as the adventure to find the island from Calphon’s dream. Despite the fleet’s distance from familiar stars, without Corsairs hounding their every move, it was a relatively simple matter to head northeast until they reached the coast of Middle-earth, following it north to the Gulf of Lune. The heroes were constantly on the lookout for black sails, but none were seen along their journey. Finally, they reached the safety of the Grey Havens, and were welcomed by the ringing of bells and elves singing over the gulf.\nOn the evening of their arrival, they were brought to the meeting hall once more, and they celebrated, for their quest had been accomplished. The Elves bid them tell of their journey, and the company obliged, although Calphon remained silent for much of the tale.\nCírdan took great interest in the company’s story, as they told of their voyage to find the island, and of their exploration of the ancient ruins of Númenor. “I’m not sure how I knew where to look,” Calphon said of his discovery in the shrine to Morgoth. “T’was as if... as if I was remembering something from my past, from a long time ago.” He reached into his doublet and pulled out the mysterious black key, which he’d placed on a thin chain around his neck, and set it onto the large table in the center of the council. “This strange key is all we found on the island. We thought that perhaps the wise Elves of the Havens would know what significance it holds.”\nThe Elves examined the key closely for some time, and Círdan stroked his beard in contemplation. Finally, Galdor, one of the wisest in Círdan’s council, broke the silence. “It is surely Númenorean in design, and yet there is something odd about it. I know not what lock it might open.” Calphon sighed, feeling hopeless. Galdor handed the key to Círdan, and as soon as he took it in his hands, a shudder coursed through his body.\n“There is an unwholesome quality to this key,” he said, turning the black key over in his hands and staring at it as though attempting to look through it. Before he could examine it further, they heard a commotion on the watch towers. “The sea-watchers!” Galdor shouted. The heroes rushed to the tall windows overlooking the gulf. To their dismay, they could see Corsair ships advancing from the west, their black sails difficult to see under the cover of night. Arrows red with fire began to fill the sky, and skiffs rushed toward the docks.\nThe chamber erupted into chaos. “Corsairs! Corsair raiders are upon us!” Elves and Men shouted outside the tower, and the sounds of battle boomed like a storm around them. The smell of burning wood wafted in from outside. Círdan ordered Calphon and the other Elves to make their way to safety before turning to the heroes and asking for assistance. “They’re burning the ships in the harbor!” he exclaimed, distraught. “We must prevent them from destroying the fleet!” Nodding in agreement, the heroes drew their blades and ran to join the fray.",
        "doNotRead": "The battle was hard fought, and several ships were lost in the flames. But with the heroes’ assistance, the Elves were able to turn the tide of the battle and repel the Corsairs. The Corsair leader, a hardened captain named Sahír, ordered a full retreat, and their ships fled quickly west out of the Lune.\nThe Elves put out the remaining fires and took stock of what had been lost in the raid. “Corsairs have never been seen this far north. What purpose did attacking the harbor serve?” one of the heroes asked aloud. “They had not the numbers to take the Havens.” There was a murmur of agreement at first, until one by one they realized their folly. The heroes thought about their voyage to the island, and how the Corsairs had seemed to know of their plans, pursuing them far into the Belegaer.\n“Lord Calphon!” a voice among them shouted, and they ran back into the tall tower overlooking the gulf, weapons still drawn. With haste they flew up many flights of steps, until finally they reached the quarters of Lord Calphon, bursting through the door.\nThey were too late. The nobleman lay slain on the floor of his chambers, a pained expression upon his face. He had a deep wound in his chest, as though skewered by a sword. Several of Calphon’s bodyguards, along with a few Corsairs, were also killed in the struggle. The mysterious black key, and the thin chain upon which it hung, was missing. A three-pronged hook was latched to the base of one of the open windows, and a long rope trailed down to the sea below.\n“We have no time to lose,” one of the heroes spoke after a moment of shock and mourning. “The Corsairs have taken the key. That is why they retreated: they’d already accomplished their goal.” The heroes gave their final regards to the nobleman from Dol Amroth, and went with haste to the Dream-chaser. There, Círdan was assessing the damage done to his greatest work, and to the other ships in the Elven fleet. When they gave him the news of Calphon’s murder, he shook his head with dismay.\n“You must pursue them, as fast as the wind can take you. I give to you the helm of the Dream-chaser once more. I’m sure Calphon’s crew would give leave to let you captain his ships, in his stead.” His eyes shone bright as the stars above. “The road ahead will be uneasy, and I know not where it ends. But that key is at the heart of things, that much is certain. Find it, and discover its purpose!” The heroes nodded and departed at once, in search of the artifact, and in revenge for Calphon.\nNa’asiyah slid her knives back into her bandolier, disgruntled. They’d accomplished their goal, but Sahír had completely ignored her plan. She and a small team of her best raiders had taken a rowboat and snuck up to the Elven towers under the cover of the evening mist. With their skill in stealth, they should have been able to infiltrate the tower, subdue the Gondorian, and grab the artifact without notice. Instead, the moment they had reached the tower, they heard bells and sounds of battle.\nWith all of Mithlond alerted to their presence, Na’asiyah’s job had became much more difficult. The nobleman’s bodyguards were well-trained, and several of Na’asiyah’s raiders had been lost in the fray. In the end, they had been forced to slay the Gondorian in order to get the key. She’d hoped to capture the nobleman; to make it look like he had simply vanished, so they could have made a clean getaway. But thanks to Sahír’s attack, that option had been impossible.\nAs soon as the Stormcaller and its fleet were out of sight of the Havens, she stormed into the Captain’s quarters, arms folded across her chest. “With all due respect Captain, what happened out there? Attacking the Havens was our plan of last resort. I thought we were going to sneak in and retrieve the artifact, not start a damned war.”\nCaptain Sahír was sitting in his chair, legs raised and crossed on his table. He looked exceedingly pleased with himself, smiling as he turned the black key over and over in his hand. “Na’asiyah,” he said casually, “We are Corsairs. We do not sneak about as thieves in the night. The sea is ours. Those who would share it must tremble to see our sails on the horizon.”\n“Captain, did you not choose me to be your first mate? If you were going to ignore my advice, the least you could have done was warn me. Now we have stirred the hornet’s nest. We could have vanished in the night, and been leagues from the Havens before they even knew the key was gone. Now they will surely pursue us with all the speed they can muster.”\nSahír’s smile diminished, and his eyes met Na’asiyah’s with a sinister glare. “My dear Na’asiyah, are you afraid of them?”\n“Of course not, Captain,” she said calmly, her eyes narrow. She’d questioned the wisdom of Sahír’s plan, but she had no qualms about spilling blood, if it be her Captain’s will. “I just hope that your prize was worth the lives of the sailors we lost.” She left with a curt nod, closing the door to Sahír’s quarters behind him. The sailors on the deck looked to her for orders, as they often did when Sahír was preoccupied. Sea-wind coursed through her thick hair, and she felt a moment’s reprieve from strife and anger. “Well? What are you waiting for, you lousy lot?” she shouted to the crew, hotly. “We’ve got ships to outrun! Full sail ahead!”",

        "flavorIntro": "The Dream-chaser and her fleet departed at once from the Grey Havens, sailing swiftly on a fortuitous wind. Calphon’s men toiled with renewed vigor, filled with fire and vengeance over the death of their lord. Their foe had a considerable lead, but the heroes swore that the Corsairs would not escape justice.\nBy the time the rising sun was visible on the horizon, the Dream-chaser and her fleet had left the Gulf of Lune and turned south. The Blue Mountains loomed over the coast to the east. “Given the speed of our pursuit, we will surely be upon them soon,” one of the heroes surmised. “Our target is the ship we saw at the Grey Havens – that is where their captain retreated after the battle.”\n“But they will not be sailing alone,” said another. The sailors and soldiers in the company nodded in understanding, ready for battle.\n“Enemy ship sighted!” The shout came from a raider high atop the Stormcaller’s main mast. The entire crew was now echoing the alarm, taking their positions and preparing for battle.\nNa’asiyah made her way to the quarterdeck, pushing through the sailors in her way. “Don’t just stand there, you fools!” she shouted to the crew as they parted for her. “I want three of you on each oar and eyes to the north! Signal the rest of the fleet! Make sure they are ready for battle!” The crew snapped-to and raised their voices in a rhythmic shanty as they pulled the oars.\nThe captain was at the helm, wearing his usual smile, sea-wind flowing through his dark hair. If he had heard the crew’s shouts of alarm, he did not look worried. Na’asiyah took the narrow steps two at a time, running to the ship’s edge. The raised deck gave her a perfect view of the northern horizon. Sure enough, a white ship was in swift pursuit, its sails bulging with wind at its back. Her dark eyes narrowed.\n“Already they are on our tail,” she said with disdain, quiet enough to mask her concern from the crew, but loud enough for the captain to hear.\n“They are fierce sailors, I’ll give them that,” Sahír noted. “But they are no Corsairs. Their corpses will litter the sea-bottom before the end.”\nNa’asiyah strode to the helm and leaned against the railing, her arms crossed over her chest. She had lived most of her life under Captain Sahír’s command, and she could not remember him this bloodthirsty. Not that he had ever been gentle or soft-spoken, but his brutality had always been... purposeful. Deliberate.\nShe gave her captain a piercing gaze, and they locked eyes. “When are you going to tell me what the key opens?” she asked, for what seemed like the hundredth time since they sailed from Umbar.\n“When you are ready,” he barked. It was the only reply he ever gave her. She took a dagger from her bandolier and ran a finger along its edge, deep in thought. Sahír had taken their fleet far to the north, farther than they had sailed in her entire life. He’d told the crew that they were to follow a Gondorian ship sailing out of Dol Amroth, a ship he somehow knew would be heading north along the western coast, and still she had no idea where he’d learned this information. It wasn’t until they saw the Gondorian ships with their own eyes that Na’asiyah and the rest of the crew believed the captain was telling the truth.\nPerhaps Sahír was right. Perhaps she wasn’t ready. Despite following his orders for years, she’d doubted him. “Do not toy with me, captain,” she said, sheathing her dagger. “I understand you have a plan. I simply want to know what we’re getting into.”\nSahír laughed heartily. “War, my dear.” He grinned. “We’re getting into war.”",
        "doNotRead": "The chase was longer than either party had anticipated. Although the heroes had quickly gained on the Stormcaller, before the voyage was over, the weather had changed for the worse. Harsh winds and rough waves slowed their progress, and other Corsair ships harassed them at every opportunity, blocking their passage and forcing them into battle. With every setback, the Dream-chaser prevailed, much to the dismay of the Stormcaller’s crew, who cursed the heroes each time their white sails appeared on the horizon.\nAfter many days, traveling as fast as the wind could take them, the heroes finally caught up to the Corsairs, sailing around the Cape of Andrast at the southern edge of the western coast. A terrible storm wracked the seas and threatened to sink both fleets. Flashes of lightning splintered across the sky, and waves as tall as hilltops crashed into the bow of every ship that dared to round the cape. When the skies finally settled, the mast of the Dream-chaser had begun to splinter, and its sails were torn. Luckily for the heroes, the Stormcaller was also damaged. Both ships remained sea-worthy, but neither would be outrunning the other for some time.\n“Get ready to board the Corsairs!” one of the heroes shouted from the bow of the ship. Those who were in fighting shape lifted their swords high in the sky and began to sing, their voices echoing across the cliffs facing the water.",

        "flavorIntro": "With the squall still raging all around them and the Dream-chaser and her fleet damaged from their long pursuit, boarding the Stormcaller was a risky maneuver, and grappling with the ship would be even more difficult. The heroes decided that their best course of action would be to take control of the Stormcaller, subduing its crew while their other ships remained a safe distance away. Command of the Dream-chaser was given to Calaerion, an Elven sailor who had journeyed with them from the Grey Havens. Beneath the ship, the sea rumbled, though most of the crew scarcely noticed, and those that did paid no heed, their attentions turned towards the Stormcaller and its crew.\n“Remember, we need the key they stole from Lord Calphon,” one of the heroes announced. “We need to know the key’s purpose. If anyone knows, it’ll be their captain. So we must take him alive, if possible.” United, the crew took positions on the Dream-chaser’s starboard side, grabbing ropes to swing across. Their ship drifted into position as the Raiders on the Stormcaller prepared for battle. Blades rose over the Belegaer, and shouts rang out: “For Lord Calphon! For the Grey Havens!”",
        "doNotRead": "The battle against the Raiders had been swift and fierce, but it was the terrifying attack of a monster under the waves that truly set the heroes on edge. Forced to join forces with the Corsairs they had sworn to put to justice, it took all of their combined skill and strength to save the Stormcaller from sinking.\nFinally, the monster succumbed to their blades, a number of its many arms dismembered. Slowly it sank back into the depths of the ocean, never to be seen again.\nTurning their attention to each other once more, the Corsairs and the heroes parted slowly, realizing their truce was at an end. “Lay down your arms,” one of the heroes commanded, weary from battle but still willing to fight. “Give command of this ship to us and we will spare your lives.” Several of the Corsairs who were still in fighting shape spat on the deck of the ship, swearing that they would never surrender. Both sides had suffered losses, and the Stormcaller seemed barely sea-worthy, but the Corsairs were prepared to continue the battle.\nBut, to the surprise of all, the captain threw his cutlass onto the deck and bowed.\n“I fear that we have started off on the wrong foot!” he said with a charming grin. “Please, allow me to introduce myself.” The heroes looked at one another, confused, but allowed the captain to speak. “I am called Sahír, and I am captain of this vessel you intrude upon. This is my first mate, Na’asiyah,” he continued, motioning towards the woman at his side. She had a dusky complexion, with long black hair in twisting, matted locks. A pattern in ink covered her arms and cheeks.\n“Captain, what are you doing?” she asked quietly, her dark eyes narrow, still holding her knives at the ready. She’d anticipated the captain to command his crew to fight to the death. The last thing she expected was for Sahír to parlay with the enemy.\nSahír gave her a toothy grin in return. “Aren’t you always advising me to use caution when outnumbered? Put those toothpicks of yours down and let’s have a friendly conversation.” Confused, Na’asiyah nonetheless followed her captain’s orders, dropping her knives to the ground. The other members of the crew followed suit.\nThe captain turned his attention back to the heroes, gesturing to his crew. “There, you see? We have laid down our arms. Time to fulfill your end of the bargain.”\nThe heroes looked at one another, concerned. “I don’t trust him one bit,” one of the heroes said at once. “Neither do I,” another responded, “but he’s surrendered and unarmed. We are honor-bound to take the crew alive and unharmed.” The other heroes nodded in agreement. They began to take the Corsairs into custody, binding their wrists and arms with rope. Many of the Corsairs struggled and cursed at the heroes, but none were willing to disobey their captain’s order.\nThe Dream-chaser circled back and the two ships were grappled together by rope, and wooden planks were lowered to allow the prisoners to cross onto the Elven ship. The Stormcaller was too heavily damaged to sail on its own, but with enough hands on oars, the two ships together could set forth. The Corsairs were brought intoa makeshift brig beneath the deck of the Dream-chaser, and much to their surprise, were treated with respect. They were given fresh fruit and clean water to eat and drink, and their wounds were tended with care. Na’asiyah and the other Corsairs were amazed by the care their hated enemies showed them. No Corsair crew would ever show such mercy, and Na’asiyah expected no better from Gondorians and their allies.\nIt quickly became clear that they had to find land soon, in order to repair the Dream-chaser’s mast, which made dreadful splintering noises each time the wind picked up, and looked ready to snap at any moment. They debated heading north to the coast, but weren’t sure if they could make it in time. Sahír, who overheard their conversation, was eager to assist. “There’s another way,” he offered. Na’asiyah raised an eyebrow, unsure of the captain’s plan. “An island I know of, to the east. Not far from here in fact. Plenty of trees for lumber, and food enough for both of our crews. What say you?” He grinned.\n“And why should you help us?” one of the heroes asked, uncertain of Sahír’s intentions.\n“Do you not remember the monster that tore apart my ship?” Sahír spat. “I have a stake in this, too.”\nThe heroes debated for a short time. They felt that they couldn’t trust the Corsair at his word, but their options were limited. If there indeed was an island nearby, they could gather supplies and use the time to interrogate Sahír about the artifact he had stolen from Calphon. “Fine,” they decided. “Give us the proper heading and we will follow it. Then, we’re going to have a discussion about what happened at the Havens.”\n“Of course,” Sahír replied with a sly grin. “I am looking forward to it.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes weren’t sure what to expect after following the heading given to them by Captain Sahír. But sure enough, just before high noon the next day, an island emerged from a curtain of rain on the horizon. With the exception of the western beach facing the fleet, the island’s coast consisted of steep cliffs and sharp jetties. Dotting the landscape were overgrown ruins peeking out from the cover of the trees, and atop the highest plateau, a grand temple.\n“This looks familiar,” one of the heroes said under his breath, and the others agreed – it was all too similar to the island from Calphon’s dream; the island where this all began. “Let’s anchor the ships off the shore, and then we’ll get answers.” They sent a few sailors in skiffs to scout ahead, search the shore for any danger, and set up camp. Then, the heroes went below deck to speak with their prisoners.\nThe Corsairs were still bound below in a small hold. Some were grateful for the provisions and bandages given to them; others remained spiteful and looked at their captors with hateful eyes. In the back of the hold, sitting with their arms bound, was Captain Sahír and his first mate, Na’asiyah. “I take it from the commotion above deck that you’ve found the island,” Sahír said as the heroes entered the chamber. “Believe me now?”\n“We’ll believe you when we know the full story,” one of the heroes responded, holding up the black key. They’d taken custody of the artifact after searching Sahír. “You followed us all the way to an island in the middle of the ocean. An island where we found this.” The hero holding up the key followed the captain’s eyes as he gazed at the artifact. “What does it open?”\nCaptain Sahír shrugged his arms and smirked. “Was the ancient lore and deep wisdom of the Elves not enough to figure it out?” The heroes shifted uncomfortably, angry at the captain’s mockery of Círdan and the Elves, but unable to refute his claim. “Alas, I was only sent to recover the key and the chest it opened. I know nothing of its contents,” he responded. Na’asiyah turned her head and glowered at her captain.\n“So you came all this way, pursued us over the wide ocean, and spilled this much blood... And you don’t even know why?” One of the heroes said angrily, his knuckles white.\n“If I had asked politely to hand over the key,” the captain mocked, “would you have obliged?”\nThe heroes ignored Sahír’s sarcasm and continued with the issue at hand. “This new island you’ve led us to – it is much like the island where we found this key. It bears temples and ruins from an age past. What was your true purpose in bringing us here?”\n“Alright, alright,” Sahír appeased the hero. “You win. Come, bring me up on deck, and I’ll tell you what I know.” The heroes brought both Sahír and Na’asiyah upstairs to the edge of the ship. “See that big temple?” Sahír asked, unable to point but motioning with his head towards the large temple to the east. “Somewhere inside lies the chest the black key opens.”\nThe heroes–as well as Na’asiyah–were stunned. “You’re sure?” one of the heroes asked. “He’s lied before. He could have been lying this whole time, for all we know,” another hero added.\n“Aye, and I could have led you into a maelstrom, or a fleet of my best Raiders. But I led you here, instead,” Sahír responded. “All I ask is that you bring me and my first mate along with you when you search the island.”\n“And why should we do that?”\nThe captain smirked. “Because I’m the only one who knows where the chest is inside that temple, and I’m assuming you don’t feel like scouring every inch of the place while fending off the cursed dead. So, if you’ll excuse me,” he said, walking back towards the hatch leading below deck, “I’ll be catching up on some well-deserved rest while you make camp.”nThe heroes watched carefully as he was led below deck by one of the other sailors. After a few moments, Na’asiyah broke the silence. “I feel obliged to thank you for saving our ship.” She paused and took a deep breath before continuing, as though the words were difficult to say. “You could have destroyed the Stormcaller and thrown us into the depths of the sea if you wanted. But you didn’t.” She locked eyes with one of the heroes, her brows furrowed with doubt. “Why?”\n“That is not our way,” one of the heroes responded, and the others nodded in agreement.\nNa’asiyah lowered her gaze in thought, and her fierce exterior diminished for just a moment. Doubt and remorse were etched in her expression. Finally, after seeming locked in thought, she nodded to the heroes in understanding, and turned to follow her captain below deck.\nThe heroes discussed their options, but in the end they had little choice. If the island was anything like the one from Calphon’s dream, it would be crawling with ancient dead, and Sahír’s knowledge of the chest’s location was too valuable to leave behind. When it came time to explore the island, they cut both Sahír and Na’asiyah’s bonds, and gave them back their weapons. After all, two more warriors as skilled as they would surely come in handy. Grinning, Sahír led the way into the jungle...",
        "doNotRead": "The island was covered in dense jungle, and it was difficult for the heroes to find their way. The ancient overgrown ruins were as dangerous as the jungle itself, inhabited by cursed undead who attacked the intruders with an unnatural malice. Finally they had defeated the guardian who held the gate key to the eastern temple, and made their way across the island at last to the temple’s vast halls.\nThough it was decayed from an age of corrosion and disrepair, the temple was grand and ornate. The adventurers could tell that, at one time, it must have been a beautiful–and terrible–place. Golden candelabras lined the halls, the doors were bejeweled with finely-cut gemstones, and the tapestries that hung from the walls were once bright and colorful. Now, the temple’s chambers were drenched in water, and the deeper they delved, the more crumbled and flooded it became. After traveling through the temple for some time, they reached a chamber with an opening in the wall, a crevasse that served as the entrance to a wide cavern. The walls were no longer worked stone like the rest of the temple, but dripping cavern walls, overgrown with vines, with mushrooms growing at their feet. Not a hundred feet further, they reached a wide precipice overlooking what appeared to be a pool of water. A pillar of light shining from the broken ceiling refracted off the surface of the water and illuminated the chamber in a brilliant blue hue. “Ah, here we are,” Sahír said, taking off his leather coat and his boots, one at a time.\n“What exactly are you doing?” one of the heroes asked, confused.\n“Oh, did I not tell you?” The captain gave a mischievous smirk. “We’ll have to go swimming, deep underwater, to get to the chest. Well? What are you waiting for? Not going for a swim in all that armor, I hope,” he chuckled, and without warning, leaped into the pool of the grotto.\nThe heroes sighed and began to disrobe, as well. “I wonder what else he’s neglected to tell us...”",

        "flavorIntro": "The water of the grotto was dark, and flecked with ice. With much of their armor removed, the adventurers felt vulnerable and naked in its chilling grasp. The first thing they had done was tie a line of cord to a stalagmite near the entrance, so they would not lose their way navigating the depths of the grotto, but the cord’s length would surely run out before they reached the secret chamber Sahír spoke of.\nSahír motioned for the group to follow, and they swam to the opposite side of the chamber. With a deep breath, Sahír dove underwater, and the party quickly followed suit, making sure not to lose sight of him should he try to lose them. He led them down a long tunnel near the floor of the cavern. As the tunnel stretched on, their throats began to tighten and their lungs begged for air. Strange plant life and stranger fish inhabited the caves, sea kelp pulling at their limbs as they swam. At last, they saw the water’s surface as the tunnel turned upwards, and they emerged from the water, shaking from the cold, and coughing for air. Sahír looked about for a few seconds before marching off, threatening to leave the heroes behind if they didn’t keep up.\n“Is he always like this?” One of the heroes asked Na’asiyah, who had lingered behind, not knowing the way as Sahír did.\n“The captain believes in inner strength, not help from others,” she explained, coldly. “If one is too weak to survive alone, help is not deserved.”\nThe heroes walked beside her, with Sahír leading the way ahead. “That must be a hard and lonely way to live, unable to seek assistance from others,” one of the heroes said. Individually, the heroes were strong and capable of great feats, but many times they had relied on the leadership of great captains, the wisdom of the Elves and the Istari, and the skilled hands of healers. Without this aid, they might have perished long ago.\nNa’asiyah looked at her feet for a moment, her jaw clenched. When she spoke, her voice was harder. “It is the only way I have ever known. To fight. To sail. To be free.”\nOne of the heroes shook her head. “I am sorry, but you will never truly be free, not while the Corsairs live under the thumb of Mordor.” Na’asiyah glowered back, eyes narrow.\n“We do not do the bidding of Mordor,” she said sharply. “We fight the Gondorians because they are our enemy. They want nothing more than to stamp us out like a nest of ants.”\n“That is the will of Mordor, not Gondor,” the hero responded adamantly. “It is the servants of Sauron who breed war, death and hate.”\nNa’asiyah considered the hero’s words, trying to understand. Her whole life, she had been told that the Gondorians and their allies were cruel and terrible, that their only love was in war, and that the Corsairs must be strong if they wished to remain free. But in just a short time, she’d experienced something very different. Those she’d met were skilled in war, but did not relish battle. They enjoyed each other’s company, and fought to protect those they cared for. They mourned the loss of Lord Calphon, and yet they spared the Corsairs’ lives and even saved them from certain death.\nA few minutes later, the tunnel opened up into a larger cavern. Sahír stopped in his tracks, looking about. “What’s wrong, lose your way?” one of the heroes called ahead.\n“Ah, shut your trap,” the captain snapped back. “It’s not as if I’m going from memory here.” Before the heroes could protest, a low-pitched wail echoed throughout the chamber, and the sounds of splashing and scraping surrounded them.\n“We’re not alone,” one of the heroes said quietly. They drew their weapons and forged on.",
        "doNotRead": "The escape from the grotto was a blur. Angry, lost, and set upon on all sides by the cursed undead, it was a wonder they were able to make it out at all. They struggled to find their way, running and swimming as fast as they could to try and catch up to Sahír, but he was too far ahead. Worse yet, the captain had removed the cord they had used to mark their passage, and they were lost in the grotto for some time. By luck or fate, they finally found the entrance. Without discussion, they took a moment to rest, kneeling and leaning against one another to catch their breath and dry in the sunlight outside the grand temple.\n“I knew we should not have trusted him!” one of the heroes gasped, repeating what was on all of their minds.\n“What are we going to do?” Another asked, looking towards Na’asiyah. “... And what about her?”\n“What about me?” Na’asiyah snapped at the hero, angrily. “Need I remind you that he left me to die back there?”\nThere was a long pause before Na’asiyah spoke again, softer this time. “I knew there was something wrong about this voyage right from the beginning. Sahír knew about the Gondorian nobleman, but did not tell us how. He said we were to follow him, but did not tell us why. He knew what the key was for, but he did not tell me what it opened.” She took a deep breath, and added, “And he told you that he was ‘sent’ to retrieve it, but I have never known the captain to serve anyone but himself.”\nThe heroes considered her words carefully. “Na’asiyah, I don’t know what your captain is plotting, but please, help us stop him. Círdan warned us about that key. Whatever is in that chest must be of great value, to go to these lengths to retrieve it.”\nNa’asiyah nodded, although she remained unsure. “I’ll help you get to Sahír. I owe you that, at least. And besides, I have some questions to ask him myself.” She rose to her feet and started walking back towards the western coast, and the heroes followed.\nWhen they broke the treeline, they saw that the Stormcaller was gone, and their camp on the beach was destroyed. The bodies of several sailors who were cutting down trees for wood to repair the mast lay dead on the ground. All but one of the canoes they had brought to the shore had cracks punched through their hull, and the last was missing entirely.\n“He really did us in,” one of the heroes said after they’d examined the camp. “But at least our fleet is still afloat. And look there!” the hero exclaimed, waving out to the west. A skiff was rowing towards them, led by Calaerion, the Elf they’d put in command of the Dream-chaser.\nAs they rowed back to the Dream-chaser, the Elves reported what had happened. “We saw him taking one of the canoes from the shore and heading this way, but before we could apprehend him, several of the Corsairs we’d taken prisoner broke their bonds and attacked us,” he explained. “Fortunately, none of our crew were slain in the struggle, but they managed to escape on the Stormcaller. We didn’t want to leave you behind, so we stayed in the hope that you would arrive. We were about to send a search party when we spotted you on the coast.”\n“Sahír must have sent one of his birds back to the ship once he reached the jungle,” Na’asiyah explained. “I’ve seen him do it before, when we were stranded on an island off the coast of Harad. He always has a trick up his sleeve.” She looked to the eastern horizon as the sun began to set. “The Stormcaller can’t be far, as damaged as it was. But there is a Raider fleet gathered nearby – we’d planned on meeting up with them once we’d recovered the artifact. He’ll have signaled them by now. Even if your ships were in top condition, you wouldn’t be able to take them. You’re going to need help.”\nThe heroes agreed with Na’asiyah’s advice, and took command of the fleet. “Alright then,” one of them ordered resolutely, “We’ll repair the ships as fast as we can... and then, we head to Dol Amroth.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes were beyond relieved when they finally entered the inlet of Cobas Haven. Tall lighthouse towers guided their path through the bay as the dawn sun painted the sky with shades of orange and pink. The castle of Dol Amroth loomed over the coast to their starboard side, on a high promontory that overlooked the bay. It was a beacon of hope to all who looked upon it. Even Na’asiyah seemed in awe of its strength and beauty, struck in silence for much of the voyage.\nThe bay was filled with Gondorian ships – some simple fishing vessels, others built for war. Horns and bells sounded in the towers around them as the Dream-chaser docked. The sailors immediately set to work, continuing the repairs on their fleet, which became a much simpler task when docked in friendly waters. The heroes asked to speak with Prince Imrahil, and they were brought into the castle at once. The prince was eager to hear their tale.\nThe heroes entered the grand hall of Dol Amroth, a large chamber with many open windows and a balcony that overlooked Cobas Haven. The walls were decorated with banners depicting a silver ship with a swan-prow on a blue sea. Servants brought them fresh food and water, and tended to their wounds while they rested. Na’asiyah half expected to be treated with disdain or contempt, but–to her surprise–the moment the heroes told the knights that she was an ally of theirs, she was given the same respect and courtesy as any other in the heroes’ company.\nPrince Imrahil came to the heroes as soon as he was given word of their arrival in the castle. Although he greeted them with joy, he grew concerned when he did not count Lord Calphon among them. “Where is Lord Calphon? I was given word that he had met with you and Círdan at the Grey Havens, but no message has come since. When I was told of your arrival, I expected he would be with you.”\n“Alas,” one of the heroes said mournfully, “Lord Calphon is not among us. He was slain during an attack on the Havens.” Na’asiyah could see the pain and mourning in Imrahil’s face, and she felt naive and ashamed to have contributed to the battle at the Havens. Clenching her fist, she met Imrahil’s gaze with her own.\n“Tell me everything,” Imrahil said. “Spare no detail.” The heroes obliged, and together they explained to the prince everything that had led to their arrival in Dol Amroth – their discovery of the black key, the attack on the Grey Havens, their pursuit of the Stormcaller, and their exploration of the undersea grotto. Imrahil listened carefully, especially to Na’asiyah’s story, for it was one of the first times he had ever spoken to a Corsair as an ally. Both Imrahil and the heroes were surprised to hear that Na’asiyah’s original plan did not involve the killing of Lord Calphon.\n“So you believe that Sahír has summoned the Corsair fleet?” Imrahil asked at last, and Na’asiyah nodded with certainty.\n“Sahír is a cunning pirate, but whatever is in that chest has him obsessed. He will seek to protect his prize through whatever means necessary.” Na’asiyah now understood the kind of person her former captain truly was. “He never really did care for any of us. It pains me that I never noticed. He stoked our anger with lies, told us of crimes against our people that were never committed, tricked us into thinking we fought for our freedom,” she explained, her words sharpened with anger. “In truth, we only ever fought for him, to solidify his dominion over Umbar.”\nPrince Imrahil nodded, placing a hand on Na’asiyah’s shoulder. “He has not won yet,” he said. “We will muster our fleet and head south at once. If it is a battle Sahír wants...” Imrahil began, but his sentence was interrupted by the sound of horns over the bay. Shouts erupted from outside: “Corsairs! Corsairs from the south!” The heroes ran to the balcony and saw an approaching host of black ships.\n“He’s sent his fleet to intercept us while he escapes to Umbar,” Na’asiyah said. “It’s what I would have done. Ironic that the first time he would heed my advice would be after I have left his service.”\nImrahil commanded his captains to prepare for battle before turning once more to the heroes. “Aid me in defending my city, and I will make sure your ships have a clear path to catch Sahír.”\nOne of the heroes clasped arms with Imrahil, concurring. “We would have defended Dol Amroth either way.”\n“I’m coming with you,” Na’asiyah declared, her expression purposeful. “I believe the Corsairs are in need of a change of leadership.”",
        "doNotRead": "The battle was fierce and the Corsairs relentless. Driven by hatred and malice, the raiders spared none in their thirst for blood. Many Gondorian ships were destroyed in the battle, rammed by cruisers with iron serpent-prows, set aflame by fiery arrows, or crushed by heavy stones thrown by trebuchets.\nIn the end, however, Dol Amroth stood triumphant, as it had many times before. The Dream-chaser and her fleet broke through the Corsairs’ blockade, heading south with all of the speed they could muster. One way or another, this game of cat-and-mouse would end soon.",

        "flavorIntro": "It took several days before the Dream-chaser and her fleet arrived at the coast of Umbar. With the fleet’s sails restored, they were able to harness the full strength of the wind. By the time they spotted the first watch tower off the coast, they were exhausted. But they knew they had no choice but to press on, for they were deep in Corsair waters, and there was no turning back.\n“There!” one of the Elven sailors shouted from the bow of the ship. He pointed to the south, his keen eyes spotting something through the night fog. “The Stormcaller! We’ve caught it!” The crew prepared for battle, and a surge of adrenaline coursed through them. They gained quickly on the Stormcaller, and could hear the raucous shouts, cries and curses coming from its raiders.\nSoon after, alarms sounded from the coast. The watch towers had spotted them. It was now or never.",
        "doNotRead": "Sahír staggered in pain as he was dealt the final blow, leaning against a stone pillar for support. He clutched the black sword in his hands with surprising strength for one so mortally wounded. “No... The sword... is mine...” the captain stammered. The words came slowly for him, every breath wracked with pain.\nOne of the heroes approached Sahír warily. The captain’s blade was different from the cutlass he’d carried before. It was etched with runes and forged from a black metal the heroes did not recognize. Judging from its size and material, it was clear that this blade was the object in the black chest – the artifact Sahír was after all along. He turned towards Sahír with pity in his eyes. The captain had never been a good man, but the heroes could see now that his obsession for power had been warped by the artifact. Having traveled with the captain for a short time, they could see the madness had changed him. “What is this blade, truly?” the hero asked. “How did you know where to find it?”\nSahír laughed, as he always had in the face of death, although this time it didn’t seem like he would escape his fate. “You’re asking the wrong question,” he croaked, his sentence interrupted by bloody coughs. “Not what, but whose.”\n“Whose?” The hero repeated. He recalled Calphon’s visions and looked upon the blade once more, examining its dark runes. “This blade was not forged by Elves, Dwarves, or Man. Who forged it, then? Was it forged in old Númenor?”\nSahír grinned, backing away to the edge of the balcony overlooking the sea. “Aye, it was forged an age ago, by one who was very wise, deep in the counsel of the King, and skilled in the art of smithing.” The heroes’ eyes widened, as Lord Calphon had recounted to them the tale of the fall of Númenor. “It was forged by Sauron.”\nThe heroes finally understood. The Dark Lord’s power corrupted all it touched, and Sahír was no exception. “We cannot let the Enemy get ahold of this,” one of the heroes said, stepping forward and motioning to the blade. “Sahír, hand it over.” The captain shook his head and inched further backwards, leaning dangerously close to the edge of the balcony.\n“No!” he barked, clutching the blade closely. “I will not hand to you the instrument of my doom,” he said, grimacing. He leaned over the edge of the balcony and looked down to the sea and the sharp rocks below. “I am a Corsair. I shall have a Corsair’s death,” he exclaimed, grinning wickedly. “And I shall take the sword with me into the depths!”\nWith that, Captain Sahír closed his eyes and threw himself over the balcony, falling into the ocean below. The heroes ran to the edge, but they were too late.\n“So ends Captain Sahír of Umbar,” one of the heroes declared in pity for the fallen captain. Neither the captain’s body, nor the sword he carried, could be seen below the waves crashing against the rocks. They pushed the black chest over the edge of the balcony, and threw its matching key into the ocean as well, so as to remove all traces of the artifact from the city.\n“The voyage of the Dream-chaser is at an end as well,” one of the heroes added. The shouts of Corsairs were still near, and they were deep in enemy territory with little hope of escape.",

She bent her bow to fit a new string and said, “There are too many to fight.

A desperate will to live had overtaken them, and they ran without thinking. Like hunted animals they fled deeper and deeper into the desert. Forgetting themselves and their weariness, the heroes ran and ran until at last their bodies collapsed from exhaustion. Months at sea, many fierce battles, and the shipwreck finally caught up with them, and the companions passed out on the sands as night deepened.\nWhen morning came, the harsh light of the sun wakened the heroes from their sleep, and they dragged their aching bodies to their feet. All around them was a vast desert. Sand dunes rolled away in every direction, like an endless arid sea.\n“Which way do we go?” asked the woman with the bow strapped to her back.\n“East,” replied their leader as he sheltered his eyes against the sun rising in that direction.\n“But our nearest ally lies to the north, in Gondor,” said another hero in surprise, “Should we not take the speediest way there?”\n“The speediest way would be to the west and the sea, but our ship has sunk and the Southrons still wait for us there,” said the leader. “North lies our destination, yet uncounted miles of harsh desert lie between us and there, and we have not the means to make such a journey. Our only hope is to travel the Harad Road, which lies to the east and runs north to Ithilien.”\n“Will not the Southrons seek us there as well?” asked the woman.\n“The Southrons must believe that the desert will defeat us, or they would have pursued us during the night while we slept. They clearly do not expect us to reach the other side.”\n“That may prove true enough,” said the third hero gruffly. “We have precious few supplies and little water.”\n“Then we will have to find more and be careful with what we have,” answered the leader, and with that he shouldered his gear and began walking east. The others followed after him.",

        "flavorIntro": "The leader of the heroes awoke alone inside a large hut. The walls were made of dried mud and the roof was thatched straw, but it was no crude hovel he found himself in. A thick, woven curtain covered the doorway, and a beautifully crafted rug covered the dirt floor. From outside, he could hear the bleating of goats and the laughter of children.\nOn a wooden table by the hero’s bed was a loaf of bread and a cup of water. He tried to sit up to reach the water, but a wave of dizziness washed over him, and he slumped back down clutching his head.\nA tall, dark-skinned man dressed in red and gold pulled aside the curtain and entered the room; a Haradrim warrior holding a long, broad-headed spear.\nThe warrior leaned the spear against the wall by the door and held up his palm in a sign of peace. To the hero’s surprise, the Harad man spoke in the common tongue, “You are awake. Good. My son was afraid that you would die.”\n“Who are you?” asked the hero.\n“I am Kahliel,” he answered with a deep voice, “And this is my village. We brought you here after we found you in the desert.”\n“Then I am your prisoner,” said the hero warily.\nKahliel laughed, “It is not my custom to keep prisoners in my home, or give them my son’s bed to sleep in! I am chieftain of this tribe. You are my guest.”\nThe hero was confused. He was confident they would find no help in all Harad, and yet this man had rescued him from certain death.\n“Where are my friends?” the tired hero asked, forcing himself upright in the bed.\nKahliel handed him the cup of water and said, “They are safe. Each of your friends is with a member of my tribe as you are here with me. They are resting as you are.”\nThe hero accepted the drink, and after he had taken a little, he asked, “Why are you helping us?”\nKahliel pulled a chair next to the bed, sat down, and let out a long breath. When he looked at the hero the warmth in his eyes was gone and his face was grave.\n“We were returning from Mordor when we found you,” he said.\nThe hero’s hand clenched the cup tight at the naming of Mordor, but he said nothing and Kahliel continued:\n“Every year we pay tribute to the Dark Tower. Food and lumber that we must carry from our village here in the great forest, across the wide desert, to the fortress of Cirith Gurat in the Mountains of Shadow. It is a long journey and a heavy burden for my people. But if we refuse, the Dark Lord will send his Orcs and destroy us.”\n“Then the Haradrim serve Mordor only out of fear?” asked the hero, amazed by this revelation.\n“This is true for my tribe, but many others are eager to serve. Some worship the Dark Lord and seek his favor. They even turn against their own people and sell their children to Mordor,” he said with disgust.\n“Then you have taken a great risk by helping us, Kahliel. For we are enemies of Mordor,” replied the hero with both wonder and concern.\n“I have done more than that already,” said Kahliel, his head bowed as under a great weight. “I have defied the Orcs and endangered my people.”\nThe hero watched him with great interest, wondering what he had done. When Kahliel looked up, pain and anger were written in his furled brow.\n“They wanted my son,” he growled. “Those filthy mongrels demanded I give them my child with our next tribute, but I refused! I drew my sword and swore to sever the hand that reaches for my child.”\n“Then they will come for all of you,” said the hero in amazement.\n“Yes,” sighed Kahliel. “Very soon no place in all Harad will be safe for my tribe. That is why you are here. We need your help. For it is said among our people that Gondor still defies the Dark Lord, and keeps the lands behind them safe from his Orcs.”\nThere was a look of desperation in his eyes as he spoke. “Is this true?” he asked.\n“It is true,” answered the hero. “The men of Gondor hold the passages of the great river against the Enemy, and the lands to the west have peace.”\n“Then I think we can help each other,” said Kahliel with real hope returning to his face. He held out his hand as he continued, “If you will guide us to those lands, we will help you and your friends to return to your homes.”\nThe hero clasped the Haradrim’s hand and answered, “We will get there together.”\nThe heroes would not be ready to travel for several days, so Kahliel left them to rest while he and his people prepared for the journey. His village was built on the edge of the great southern jungle where the Mûmakil roamed and the hunters of Kahliel’s tribe went at times to hunt.\nIt was into the jungle that Kahliel took his three closest companions, members of his tribe, to gather food on the eve of their departure. They were following a forest trail back to the village with enough meat to last for a long journey when they heard the howling of Wargs and the shouting of Orcs.\n“They have come!” the chieftain shouted to his companions. “Hurry! Orcs are attacking our village!”\nThe hunters dropped their game, drew their weapons, and charged into the fray.",

        "flavorIntro": "The great jungle of Harad was unlike any forest the heroes had ever entered before. It was hot and the air was humid. Beads of sweat rolled down their legs as they made their way through the dense undergrowth. Leaves of every shape were packed together so closely that they could not see more than a few feet in front of them, and the forest canopy blotted out the sky leaving them with almost no way to navigate. If they had wandered into the forest alone, it is unlikely that they would have ever found their way out again.\nYet their Haradrim guides, Kahliel and his hunters, moved among the giant leaves and low hanging vines with confidence. This jungle was their hunting ground, and the prey which they now sought was an animal they had hunted many times before: the mighty Oliphaunt. A beast large enough for many men to ride upon its back, and strong enough to carry them all the way to Gondor. The Haradrim called the beasts Mûmakil and long ago learned the trick of capturing them and riding them. In times of war they built towers upon their backs from which to shoot arrows and hurl spears, but the people of Kahliel’s tribe also used them for traveling great distances, as they hoped to now.\nTheir village was destroyed. Sauron’s Orcs had come upon the boma by night and burnt it to the ground. Howling Wargs had pursued Kahliel’s people into the jungle. The heroes barely escaped along with the few survivors of Kahliel’s tribe. With no home to return to, Kahliel made the difficult decision to leave their homeland and make the long journey north to Gondor. There he hoped the heroes would earn his people safe passage into a new land where they would be free from the power of Mordor.\nBut to reach Gondor the heroes and their friends would have to cross the vast desert of Harad. There was no hope of making that journey on foot, so they entered the jungle to capture wild Mûmakil.\nEven for an experienced hunter like Kahliel, it was a dangerous undertaking. The jungle of Harad was home to all manner of deadly creatures, from stinging insects to prowling tigers. Kahliel did not have time to explain all the dangers of the jungle to the foreigners who were with him, so he bade them be silent and step where he stepped, and stop when he stopped. In this way the heroes followed their Haradrim guides through the jungle.\nAfter a few hours of speechless travel, their guide raised his hand to signal the heroes to stop. He then waved them over to where he stood and pointed at the ground. There was a large depression in the soft earth, big enough for a man to lay down in. “Mûmak,” whispered Kahliel. He looked up from the print and motioned with his eyes. The heroes followed his gaze into the jungle where they could see a trail rent in the undergrowth by enormous beast. Bent trees and crushed logs marked the Oliphaunt’s passing.\n“This track is at least one day old,” said Kahliel, speaking softly. “It leads deeper into the jungle. This is not good. Many apes live there. They do not like Haradrim or outsiders and will attack if threatened. There are other dangers too, so be alert. Follow me.”\nWith that, Kahliel resumed the hunt, and the heroes followed him.",

        "flavorIntro": "Riding atop an Oliphaunt was a new experience for the heroes. It almost reminded them of sailing. They swayed from side to side with each lumbering step of their mount like on the deck of a ship, and the dunes below them rolled into the horizon like the waves of the sea. Overhead, the stars shone bright and the white light of the moon illuminated the desert around them.\nThey traveled mostly by night and rested by day to avoid the heat. They were amazed at how docile these giant creatures were once Kahliel and his men had fitted them each with a harness. The Mûmak responded to the rider’s every command. It was so simple, that Kahliel insisted the heroes try it for themselves. Their attempts provided some amusement for Kahliel’s men, but after a short while the heroes were driving the Oliphaunts with confidence.\n“Good,” said Kahliel clapping his hand on the hero’s back. “You drive well. Almost as good as my son,” he started to laugh, but it stuck in his throat and his voice trailed off.\nThe hero turned to look at him, but the chieftain would not meet his gaze. He stared into the distance, grief etched into his face. The hero chose not to say anything but turned his attention back to the task at hand. From his vantage point atop the Mûmak he had an impressive view of the desert.\nIt seemed to go on forever. The ancient road beneath them stretched off into the distance where it was obscured in the darkness.\nAs the hero’s mind wandered over the endless sand, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He wasn’t sure what it was, but he turned around to see that Kahliel was also alert and looking behind them. Had he heard something?\nThen the sound came unmistakable: the eerie howl of a Warg. He couldn’t tell for certain what direction it came from; sound could travel for miles over this open ground.\nThe Warg’s cry was answered by another. The cry came from a different direction. Then, there was another louder howl. Nearer to them but still hidden from view. Soon the whole desert was alive with the sound of Wargs. Though he could not see them yet, the hero knew: they were being hunted.\nEven from atop his towering Mûmak, the hero felt afraid. Out here in the shelterless desert, there was nowhere to hide. And where the Warg howls, there the Orc prowls. The hero gave the reigns a shake and urged his mount faster: it would be a race to the river Harnen.",

        "flavorIntro": "There had been a commotion in the night: something had startled the Oliphaunts and their trumpet calls awakened the heroes. They heard screams and the sound of scuffling, but they could see nothing in the utter darkness of the night. Kahliel called to his men to organize them, but his shouts were drowned out by the loud braying of the Mûmakil. That soon faded as the frightened beasts tore their harnesses and stampeded away into the desert.\nWhen the morning came, the heroes searched the ground for signs of what had transpired in the night. They found strange animal tracks at the edge of their camp, and heavy lines in the sand indicating that some of their company had been dragged away.\n“I don’t recognize these markings,” said one of the heroes, lightly touching one of the animal tracks.\n“There’s no blood on the sand,” observed another. “What kind of animal takes its prey without spilling any blood?” he asked.\n“The great spiders of the desert,” answered Firyal. “They use their poison to paralyze their victims, then drag them back to their den to eat them.”\n“Then we must follow the trail to their lair and rescue our friends!” exclaimed the first hero, standing up and shaking the sand from his hands.\n“Just so,” said Firyal. “What say you Kahliel: Do we pursue the Mûmakil that fled in the night? Or do we seek the spiders in their den?”\nThe Haradrim chief narrowed his eyes and gazed into the desert, then he looked at the tracks at his feet. “The Mûmakil have fled beyond our reach, but even if there was hope to recapture them, we could not abandon our friends,” he said. “Gather your weapons. We follow the spiders.”",
        "doNotRead": "The heroes found their friends bound by giant webs to the walls of the spiders’ cavern lair, but there were others there too.\n“Kahliel?” cried one. “My chief, is that you?”\nKahliel turned to see who it was that called his name. “Lorgan?” he exclaimed in astonishment.\n“Yes! It’s me!” answered a Haradrim man bound with spider cords. “And Hadid is here too! Look Hadid, our chieftain has come to rescue us.”\n“We thought you were dead.” said Hadid with wonder at seeing her chieftain alive, and in the spiders’ den.\n“We thought the same of you. How did you come to be here?” Kahliel asked as he cut them loose.\n“After the Orcs attacked the village, they took some of us captive,” answered Lorgan. “They put us in wagons and brought us to their tower in the Ephel Duath.”\n“Cirith Gurat?” asked Kahliel.\n“Yes,” said Lorgan. “They put us to work in the mines below the fortress, but we found a way out: a narrow passage that opened into the mountains. We climbed down and fled into the desert. The spiders must have captured us in our sleep because we woke up here.”\n“Then there are others of our tribe still in Cirith Gurat?” asked Kahliel.\n“Yes, my chief,” said Hadid. “Your son is there too.”\nKahliel froze. His heart dropped into his stomach. “Abaan?” he whispered, eyes wide with fear.\nThe Haradrim chieftain staggered out of the spider’s cavern and braced himself against the entrance. “My son is alive, and a captive of the Orcs,” he groaned and stared across the desert plain towards the Mountains of Shadow. Turning to face his companions, he continued: “I must rescue him.”\n“Is this possible?” asked one of the heroes. “He is a captive of Cirith Gurat.”\n“My chief, we do not have the strength to assault the fortress.” added Jubayr.\n“I am his father!” Kahliel shouted, and the others were silent.\n“I must at least try,” he stammered. “But the burden is mine alone. I do not ask any of you to come with me.”\n“You shame me, Kahliel,” said Jubayr. “I only meant to say that we need a plan.”\n“Quite right,” added the hero. “You rescued us from the desert and saved our lives. It is our duty to help you in your time of need, but we need a way into the fortress.”\n“Can we not enter in through the opening Lorgan and Hadid used to escape?” asked Firyal.\n“Perhaps.” answered the hero. “But the Orcs are certain to have noticed their escape by now, and their patrols will be doubled. If we are discovered, there will be no hope of rescue or escape.” he added thoughtfully.\n“Then we must find another way in,” said Firyal, “but how?”\n“We will enter through the front gate,” said Kahliel gazing into the distance again. This time his eyes were focused on a distant caravan coming up the Harad road. “The Black Serpent brings his tribute to Mordor as we speak. We will ambush his caravan, and march into Cirith Gurat under his banner.”",

        "flavorIntro": "“There is an old fortress at the crossroads yonder,” Kahliel pointed towards a rise in the distance, “on the other side of that ridge, where the Harad road meets the road to Cirith Gurat. The Black Serpent will camp there tonight.”\n“How do you know he will stay there?” asked one of the heroes with him. They were crouched next to each other atop a low hill in the desert watching the Serpent’s caravan as it followed the northward road and disappeared from sight behind the opposite ridge.\n“That is where we camp when we take our tribute to Mordor. All Haradrim do this,” answered Kahliel. His eyes were focused keenly on the caravan. The sun was lowering in the sky behind them, but there was enough light for him to count silhouettes. He wanted to know how many warriors were in the Serpent’s entourage before planning his raid.\n“Should we not attack them before they reach the safety of the fortress?” the hero asked.\n“No,” said Kahliel, “If we attack them on the open plain, they will scatter and we will not catch them. If we wait until they are inside the fort, then they cannot flee.”\n“But how will we enter the fort?” asked the hero.\n“The crossroads fort is a ruin: it has walls but no gate. The Haradrim camp there for the well.”\n“Then we attack through the gate and leave them nowhere to run,” the hero voiced his ally’s plan.\n“Just so,” said Kahliel.\nThe two warriors shared an understanding glance. Since making the decision to travel north together, Kahliel and the heroes\nhad hunted Mûmakil together in the jungle, fought side-by-side against the Orcs upon the desert plain, and rescued their friends from the spiders’ den. Each one of these encounters built trust between them and respect for each other’s abilities.\nBut this ambush would be different; The Black Serpent and his men were Haradrim. The hero couldn’t help but wonder how that would change things in battle, so he spoke with Kahliel as they descended from their lookout: “The men in that caravan are not Orcs or spiders, Kahliel. Are you certain that you can go through with this?”\nKahliel stopped on the hillside to face the hero. “They are worse than Orcs. Worse than spiders!” he replied sternly. His eyes were furious, but he kept his voice level. “The spider is a mindless beast. It kills only to eat. There is no malice in this. The Orc is a slave, bound to the will of The Dark One. It has no choice but to do its Master’s work. But The Black Serpent is worse than both because he is free to choose, and he chooses to serve Mordor. He worships The Dark One and dishonors his people by making them his thralls. I will not hesitate to strike him, nor will any who follow me.”\nThe hero nodded and they resumed their quiet descent back to camp. Whatever happened after their raid began, the hero was confident that he could trust his Haradrim allies in battle.",
        "doNotRead": "“The Black Serpent has escaped,” one of the heroes informed Kahliel in the aftermath of the skirmish.\n“Then he is gone,” replied Kahliel. “We have no means to pursue. Still we have his banner and his caravan, so we proceed to Cirith Gurat.”\n“He may ride to the fortress and alert the Orcs,” cautioned the hero.\n“No,” said Kahliel. “He is too proud to embarrass himself in front of his Master’s slaves that way. He will ride to his city, gather such soldiers as he has, and he will return here in wrath.”\n“Then we must be far from here when he comes,” said the hero.\n“Just so,” said Kahliel. “Let us move quickly to gather the Serpent’s things. Have each man strip one of the fallen and don his armor. I will wear the Serpent’s garb and deliver the tribute to Cirith Gurat.”\nThere were not enough disguises for all of the fighters in their company. Furthermore, there were many who were injured or otherwise unable to fight. So the heroes counseled Kahliel that he should appoint some of his warriors to take their camp further north and wait for them there.\nThe chieftain agreed and gave orders for his people to abandon the cross-roads fort and seek shelter further north. Kahliel told his people that if he did not return from the\nOrc fortress in two nights, they should continue north to Gondor without them. And with that, Kahliel and the heroes raised the banner of The Black Serpent and drove the stolen caravan along the road to Cirith Gurat.",

        "flavorIntro": "The tower of Cirith Gurat rose higher as the caravan drove towards the gate. Not as tall or mighty as Minas Ithil, it was still of Númenórean design, built after the fall of Sauron when Gondor kept watch on the land of Mordor. It was situated on the southernmost edge of the Ephel Dúath, where the mountain range bent away eastwards. From here the men of Gondor would have guarded the narrow passage into Mordor and kept watch over the land of Harondor. But as with Minas Ithil and many others, the tower of Cirith Gurat was captured by the Enemy when the vigil of Gondor failed and Sauron reentered the Black Land.\nSince that time, the tower had become an abode for Orcs and other evil creatures. The heroes could see them now: Orc sentries in sable armor standing atop the wall. Each of them was armed with a bow of equal height and a quiver of black-feathered arrows. Their eyes watched the caravan advance up the steep rampart that led to the tower gate.\nAs they drew near, Kahliel put the Serpent’s horn to his lips and blew a long note. The loud blast of an Orc horn sounded its reply from atop the wall. There was a rumble from inside the fortress and the drawbridge was lowered into place on mighty chains.\nPassing over the bridge, the caravan entered the courtyard through the gate. Slanted eyes watched them through the murder holes, and a large Warg snarled at them from its resting place inside the entrance. The heroes were disguised in the uniforms of The Black Serpent and their faces were covered by the black masks worn by his men so that only their eyes were visible. Kahliel himself wore The Black Serpent’s armor and carried the summons from Mordor. He handed the scroll to the Orc captain who approached him. The Orc didn’t bother to read them but growled in the common speech, “You’re late.”\n“We were attacked by bandits on the road,” replied Kahliel.\n“Were you now?” the Orc snarled. “And who would dare to attack The Black Serpent on the road to Mordor?” he asked mockingly.\n“Fools who are dead,” answered Kahliel. “They tried to steal the tribute that we have brought your Master, and they paid with their lives.”\n“Oh ho!” laughed the Orc. “So the Serpent has fangs after all! Well lads, better watch yourselves ‘round this lot!”\nThere was a horrible chorus of laughter from the Orcs gathered around them, but Kahliel was unmoved.\n“You will show me your dungeon while your soldiers unload the wagons,” he told the captain.\n“Will I now?” said the Orc amused. “And why would I do that?”\n“Because those are your orders,” he said, pointing to the sealed parchment in the Orc’s hand. “Read them yourself.”\nThe captain looked at the scroll with frustration, then looked back at Kahliel and snarled, “No need for that. If you want to visit the dungeon, my boys will be glad to show you. Just don’t do anything funny, or you may end up staying longer than you wish!”\n“Gharl!” he shouted to one of his soldiers, “Take these men below and show them the dungeons. The rest of you maggots get to work unloading these wagons!”\nA scar-faced Orc with long, loping arms ran over with an iron ring of keys, unlocked a heavy wooden door, and led them down to the dungeons.",
        "doNotRead": "The sun was rising as the heroes led the rescued captives away from the fortress of Cirith Gurat. They chose a winding path through the foothills of the Ephel Dúath. It was difficult and slow going, but the deep crags and giant boulders at the mountains’ feet hid them from the watchful eyes of the tower. The Orcs would not pursue them by day, not while the sun blazed overhead, but they could mark their trail easily enough if they set out across the sand too early. So they stuck to the rocky path and quietly made their way north.\nAround midday they stopped in a low valley to rest. The heroes went from captive to captive, dressing wounds and comforting frightened refugees. Kahliel sat apart and held his son to his chest. When they had found Abaan in the dungeon of the Orcs, there had been no time for Kahliel to comfort his boy. He was never more afraid than in that moment. His only concern was getting out of the fortress with his son alive. But now that Cirith Gurat was hidden from view by the Mountains of Shadow, the weight of what they had accomplished settled in and Kahliel’s composure finally crumbled. He held his son and wept.\nIt was still many leagues to Gondor, and the Orcs would undoubtedly pursue them once night fell, but in that moment Kahliel did not care. His son was alive and unhurt. Together they cried tears of joy and anguish.",

        "flavorIntro": "There were many glad reunions when the heroes returned to camp with the captives rescued from the dungeons of Cirith Gurat. Kahliel’s people cried tears of joy and wonder when they saw how many of their loved ones had survived the Orcs’ attack on their village, but their chieftain did not allow the celebration to last long. The red sun was already descending into the west by the time they returned, and the hunt would soon be up.\n“This is the last leg of our journey,” Kahliel said. “We cannot falter here. The Orcs’ will send their Warg-riders to pursue us, and The Black Serpent will send his men after us as well. We must cross the river Poros before they find us, or we may never reach Gondor.”\nThe whole company struck camp as quickly as possible. Children who were reunited with their parents held their hands, and the heroes supported the injured, as they set out across the desert.",
        "doNotRead": "After the din of battle faded and the enemy was driven back from the Crossings at Poros, there was an uncomfortable silence as the Gondorians who guarded the ford exchanged looks with the Haradrim who followed the heroes across. Nervous glances were cast from soldier to refugee and back. As Kahliel marked the mistrust in the Gondorians’ eyes he grew afraid that his people might have risked everything to reach this point only to be turned away. He looked at the heroes who had traveled here with him and wondered if they would abandon him now that they were safe.\n“Greetings,” said a Gondorian, breaking the silence. He spoke to the heroes in the common speech, but his eyes looked warily at the Haradrim who huddled together by the river bank. “I am Targon, Captain of the Crossing. Who are these people with you? And what is their business here?”\nKahliel noticed that Targon did not sheathe his blade and neither did his men, though they had lowered them since the fight. The heroes sheathed their weapons, and one of them held out his palm in token of peace before speaking, “Well met Targon of Gondor. This is Kahliel, chieftain of his tribe, and these are all that is left of his people. Their village was destroyed by Orcs after they rescued us from the desert and sheltered us in their homes. They have traveled many leagues with us to seek refuge in the land of Gondor.”\nWonder filled Targon’s eyes as he listened to the hero’s story, but he remained cautious. “How did you come to be in Far Harad yourselves?” he asked.\n“We set sail from Mithlond to avenge Lord Calphon after he was murdered by Corsairs in an attack on the Grey Havens,” answered the hero. “We pursued his killers all the way to Umbar where justice was done to the pirates who carried out the raid. But our ship was sunk and we were stranded in the City of Corsairs, so we fled into the desert. There we would have died if not for this man.” The hero put his hand on Kahliel’s shoulder.\n“The Lord Calphon is dead?” said Targon. “That is ill news, and you have done well to avenge it.” He paused a moment to consider what was said before passing his judgment, “You and your companions are free to enter the land of Gondor, but I must detain the Haradrim here; for we have not had dealings with the people of Harad since the rule of the Stewards began. It is for the Lord Denethor to decide their fate.” “Then take us to Lord Denethor by the speediest way, Captain Targon,” urged the hero. “And let Kahliel come with, so that we might plead his people’s case before the Steward.”\nThe captain was surprised by the hero’s loyalty for the Haradrim. “Very well,” he replied. “Their chieftain will represent his people before the Steward, but no others. The rest must surrender their weapons and remain here.”\nThere was some commotion among the Haradrim when they heard this, and Kahliel held his son close to his side. The Gondorians stepped forward to collect their weapons, and they looked at the heroes with nervous eyes. The heroes nodded and the Haradrim reluctantly began to offer up their weapons.\nCaptain Targon extended his hand towards Abaan and motioned for Kahliel to let him go. “The boy will be safe here under my care,” he started to say, but Kahliel stepped in front of his son and his hand went to the hilt of his sword. Death was in his eyes.\nCaptain Targon stepped back and shouted “Guards!”\nThey might have come to unhappy blows if the hero had not thrown himself between them with his hands up. “Hold!” he shouted. “Hold!” He looked at Kahliel and said, “Be still! This man is not our enemy.”\nThe chieftain’s eyes glowed hot and his nostrils flared, but he relaxed his grip and lowered his arm, never taking his gaze off the Captain.\nThe hero looked at Targon and explained, “The boy is his son, Abaan. Kahliel thought him dead after the assault on their village. He risked everything to rescue him from the Orcs in Cirith Gurat. You cannot ask them to be separated.”\nCaptain Targon only took his eyes off Kahliel for a second to glance at the boy, then to the hero, and back to Kahliel. When he saw that Kahliel had relaxed his weapon arm, he signaled his men to stand down with a wave of his arm and sheathed his sword. “I also have a son,” he said, speaking to Kahliel. “I don’t know what I would do if he were taken by Orcs, but if I had him back again I would never let go. Your son may go with you.”\nAn expression of gratitude replaced the fire that was in Kahliel’s eyes and he raised his palms in a gesture of peace. Then he slowly drew his sword and presented the hilt to Targon. As he surrendered his weapon to the Gondorian he said, “May you live to see your grandchildren’s children.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The sun shone brightly on the wide green pastures of the Anduin river valley. The tall grass swayed with a gentle breeze. Summer was already giving way to fall in the Misty Mountains to the west, but the air was still warm in the Vales of Anduin.\nIt was pleasant travel weather for a small band of adventurers who were making their way north along the western shore of the mighty Anduin. They had already come a long way. The tale of their journey spanned from the cold of Angmar to the coasts of Andrast, and from the desert of Harad to the high walls of Minas Tirith.\nIt was a hero’s tale: This company of adventurers had brought with them from the far south of Middle-earth the remnant of a Haradrim tribe whose village was destroyed when they defied Mordor. They had depended upon one another over a long and perilous journey from Far Harad to Pelargir, but they were not permitted to remain in Gondor. The steward of that land remained suspicious of the Haradrim even after the heroes’ account of their bravery, but the Lord Denethor had granted them safe passage north. They were escorted to the city of Edoras in Rohan where they sought an audience with King Theoden, but it was the king’s advisor, Gríma, who heard their plight and denied them refuge.\nOnce again the heroes and their Haradrim allies were forced to continue north. Their hope now was to seek asylum for their friends with King Brand in Dale, but it was still a long and dangerous journey across Wilderland and winter was nigh. The Haradrim, unaccustomed to the harsh cold of a Rhovanion winter, would be ill-suited to such a journey, so the heroes had left them on the northern border of Lothlórien in the care of the Galadhrim. The Lord and Lady of the Golden Wood would not allow strangers into their realm, but they agreed to shelter the refugees through the winter while the heroes traveled to see King Brand on their behalf.\nSo it was that the heroes now traveled north through the Vales of Anduin on their way to the Old Ford. The Beornings safe-guarded the passage of the river there and many small Woodmen villages dotted the west river bank along the way.It would he an easy journey through pleasant country Or so they thought .\nTheir troubles began when they saw a Warg-rider atop a low foothill of the mountains to the west. As soon as they spotted the Goblin, he turned his mount and rode out of sight down the other side of the hill. They did not see him again that day or the next, but it left them ill at ease and they took turns keeping watch at night. It was a good thing they did because on the third night the lookout saw a Mountain-troll descend from the hills and walk within a stone's throw from their camp. The lookout had fitted an arrow to her bow and was ready to wake her companions when she realized that it had not seen them and was heading south. When she shared this news with the rest of the company the next morning, it caused a stir.\n“ A stray Warg-rider is one thing, but Trolls are another!” exclaimed one of the adventurers.\n“We do not know the Goblin was a stray,” counteredhis companion. “I still say it was a scout and a sign that there are more nearby.”\n“It is unusual to see these creatures this far south and on the west side of the river,” agreed the first.\n“I believe some evil is afoot. We must stay alert now; this land is no longer safe for us,” offered a third companion. All nodded their heads in agreement. They made no more conversation as they broke camp that morning, and they remained silent and alert as they resumed their journey north.",
        "doNotRead": "“I’m glad that’s over,” said the Woodman, Haldan, as he leaned wearily on his axe after the fight at the Old Ford.\n“That’s the most fun I’ve had in years!” laughed Grimbeorn. The huge Beorning gave Haldan a clap on the back that nearly topled the Woodman. “Scraps like that make me feel young again,” he added with a giant grin.\nHaldan offered a tired smile in return and massaged his shoulder where Grimbeorn had slapped him. “That may be,” he said, “but doesn’t it worry you? It isn’t like the Goblins to venture so far south, or to attack those who can fight back.”\n“Aye,” said Grimbeorn thinking about it now. “It didn’t feel like one of their raids. It was more like an act of desperation than an attack. There’ve been a fair few of these Goblins and other creatures trying to sneak across the Ford recently. It’s as if they’re trying to get away from something up north.”\n“But what could be driving Goblins and Trolls from their holes in the mountains?” asked Haldan.\nGrimbeorn and the companions all looked at each other, but no one offered any guesses as the weight of the question sank in. They all felt it though: the foreboding of worse to come.",

        "flavorIntro": "The vast and dangerous forest of Mirkwood lay before the heroes like a wall of green and black. The Forest Road ran the length of the woods from the Old Ford to the River Running, but it was a perilous crossing. The fortress of Dol Guldur to the south had again become a place of evil and its influence could be felt throughout the darkening woods, and to the north were the many webs and snares of the giant spiders. To wander off the trail in either direction was to risk becoming lost forever, and it was a long way to the other side of the forest.\nThe heroes knew all this but were determined to reach Dale and have an audience with King Brand, so they thanked Grimbeorn and the Beornings for their aid and entered the woods. Haldan went with them. The Woodman had made this journey before and the adventurers welcomed his assistance.\n“It is many days travel to the eastern edge of the forest,” said Haldan. “If we stick to the road we should not have any trouble. Traffic has lessened since the shadow returned to Mirkwood, but the trail is still easy to follow during the day. At night we camp and dare not move.”\nThe first few days were uneventful, but as they moved deeper into the woods the closeness of the forest became unbearable until each member of the company traveled in silent torment. The gloom of Mirkwood clouded their minds as well as their senses until the memory of sunlight faded into a dream.\nThat night great weariness overcame the adventurers and they fell into enchanted sleep. Haldan had first watch and as he struggled to keep his eyes open his head leaned heavily on the pommel of his axe. His mind was beginning to wander when he saw the horrible shape of a spider illuminated by the orange glow of the fire. “What a terrible vision,” he thought to himself as he stared into the bulbous eyes of the beast. It wasn’t until he saw another spider bite one of his sleeping companions that he cried out in terror and roused the others. A bitter and desperate battle ensued as the heroes struggled to cast off their weariness and defend themselves...",

It had been a harrowing journey through Mirkwood, but they had finally reached the eastern edge of the forest. They came now to the shore of the River Running, and, as luck would have it, a trade vessel sailed into view on its way north.\nThey hailed the boat and her crew steered the vessel to shore in response. The captain was a friendly Barding who welcomed them aboard and offered them safe passage in exchange for a reasonable amount of their gold. The heroes happily accepted and began loading their things onto the boat.\n“This is where we part ways,” said Haldan. “The river will carry you north to Lake-town and then to Dale, but my home lies back west.”\nOne of the heroes clasped hands with the Woodman and said, “Thank you for your help. You are a brave man, Haldan. I wish you safe travel on your return journey.”\nWith that, the heroes climbed aboard the Bardings’ boat and sailed north as Haldan waved goodbye from the shore.",

        "flavorIntro": "“Welcome, guests,” said King Brand to the small party of adventurers who had just arrived in Dale. The king sat upon a wooden throne at the far end of his great hall. About him were the knights of his guard in fine mail. Rich tapestries hung from the walls, and the king drank from a golden cup. “I understand you have traveled a great distance and through many perils to reach me. The hospitality of Dale is yours. Tell me: what errand brings you to my realm?”\nOne of the heroes stepped forward and knelt at the foot of the throne. “My lord,” she began, “our road has indeed been long and perilous. From Far Harad we escaped the grasp of Mordor with a tribe of noble Haradrim who aided us in our moment of need. They forfeited their home when they joined with us and now they are a houseless people in a foreign land. Word of your prosperity reached us in the south and we have traveled here on their behalf. King Brand, will you allow them to settle in Dale?”\nThe king stroked his beard as he considered all that had been said. “This is no small thing that you ask of me. Even here in the north we have heard tales of the savage Haradrim. It is a marvel to my ears to hear you speak of them as you do, but I do not doubt the truth of your words. The journey you have undertaken on their behalf speaks to their credit.”\nKing Brand paused for a moment before continuing, “It is timely that you arrived when you did for I have need of heroes such as you: Something drives the fell mountain creatures from the north and into my realm. An entire village was reported destroyed only yesterday. There were no survivors to tell the tale and the knights of my house are already stretched thin defending the other outlying villages. That is why I need you to investigate this attack and discover those who are responsible. I must secure the borders of my kingdom before I can admit your friends to settle here. What say you?”\nThe hero rose from where she was kneeling, drew the sword from her scabbard and held it aloft as she spoke her answer, “We will go at once to deal with this threat to your realm and will not return until it is done.”\nKing Brand also stood and said, “After it is done, you will send for your friends, and they will have a new home in my land.”",
        "doNotRead": "With a final mighty stroke the heroes hewed the fire-drake and it collapsed upon its side. As it lay there, dying, the companions caught their breath and marveled at the monster they had slain.\n“Surely this was the beast that terrorized the borders of Brand’s realm!” said one of the heroes triumphantly.\n“Indeed, not since Smaug the Golden has a dragon such as this been seen in Middle-earth,” added another. “This must be what drove the Goblins out of the mountains.”\nThe adventurers were all in agreement when a horrible, gurgling laughter interrupted their conversation. The fire-drake coughed and cackled, “Fools! When my mother learns of my death, she will set all Wilderland ablaze!”\nThe heroes looked with wonder and horror as the wounded fire-drake summoned the last ounce of its strength to glare at them. The only fire left within the beast was the rage in its eyes as it cursed its enemies: “Your cities will burn! She will leave... nothing green... alive...” it sputtered and died, and its head dropped back to the ground.\nThere was a long silence as each member of the company reeled at the dragon’s words.\n“It lies,” said one of the companions at last. “It was an evil creature, and it means to rob us of our victory with empty threats.”\n“Nay,” replied another. “My heart wishes that were true, but it warns me otherwise. The creature was evil, and evil is wont to boast. This beast could not but tell us the truth in order to ease the sting of its defeat.”\n“If that is true, then we must seek the mother before she hears of what has happened here, or else the Bardings and many more will pay the price for our victory,” added a third.\n“But where do we find the mother?” asked the first. “Wilderland is a vast and untamed country. She could be anywhere.”\n“Wilderland is vast, but a dragon cannot go long unnoticed,” answered the second companion. “I believe we have felt\nher presence on our journey already. It must have been the mother that chased the creatures from the mountains, so that is where we shall seek her: in The Withered Heath, where the dragons breed.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes had already been traveling for days when they reached the first foothills of the Grey Mountains. Their journey across the barren lands between the Iron Hills and the Ered Mithrin had been uneventful except for the weather. It had rained in torrents, soaking the travelers’ heavy cloaks and leaving them wet and miserable.\nAs they began to climb the rising slopes of the Grey Mountains, the rain turned to snow; a welcome change if not for the cold that came with it. The early frost had only just descended on Wilderland below, but already in the stony heights of the Ered Mithrin the chill winds of winter were blowing and biting at the heroes’ faces.\nNevertheless, the adventurers climbed on. The fate of Rhovanion depended on them. Somewhere in this wide mountain range lurked a terrible danger: an ancient Dragon whose scion they had cut down in the Dwarven mines beneath the Iron Hills. The dying beast warned them his mother would seek revenge when she learned of his death, and the heroes feared that all Wilderland would suffer if they did not find her first.\nSo they climbed in search of the Withered Heath, a long valley that lay amid the eastern arms of the Grey Mountains, where the Dragons were said to breed. After several days of navigating steep cliffs and narrow paths, the heroes reached the summit and looked down on the vale they sought: an ashen plain of charred, lifeless rock. There were no Dragons to be seen, but plenty of Dragon sign. As they descended into the burnt valley, they could see that the vast majority of tracks were those of hatchlings - small prints, about the size of a bear’s, leading this way and that from the scattered remains of large eggs. But after some searching they found one large set of tracks that led west and up back into the mountains.\nAfter a short rest in a low dale among the charred rocks of the Withered Heath, the heroes resumed their hunt and followed the larger Dragon tracks they had found. They were each happy to leave the scorched vale behind them, but they all knew that greater danger still waited for them amid the cold heights surrounding the Withered Heath...",
        "doNotRead": "Once again the heroes gathered around the body of a dead Dragon, but this time they knew it could not be the one they sought.\n“This one’s smaller than the first,” said one of the companions.\n“Aye, I’d imagine the mother we’re after would be much bigger,” agreed another.\n“But where do we find her?” asked the first. “The tracks that led us here were the only ones we found large enough to be an adult’s. All the others were but hatchlings.”\nThere was a brief silence as the adventurers contemplated this question when, from a dark corner of the Dragon’s lair, there came a shuffling noise. The heroes wheeled around with their weapons ready, to see a large Goblin stepping forward from the shadows with his arms held outward in token of surrender.\n“Yrch!” shouted one of the heroes, and he drew an arrow back with his bow, ready to fire.\n“Hold!” cried the Orc in a hoarse voice, “I can tell you where to find the Dragon you seek!”\nThe archer aimed at the Goblin’s chest and ordered him to speak: “Tell us what you know of this Dragon, and how you know it.”\nThe Goblin laughed bitterly and said, “Sure, sure. And while I’m at it, why don’t I tell you where I buried my loot after I raided the Woodmen so you can have all my secrets and be done with me? Garn! Urdug’s not stupid! I know yer gonna kill me once I tell you what I know.”\nThe bowman relaxed his draw, lowered his bow, and said, “Very well. I promise no harm will come to you if you speak truthfully, though it would be the first time I’ve heard an Orc do so.”\n“Well, that’s better!” said Urdug. He sat down on the Dragon’s corpse and gave it a pat. “You make short work of Dragons it seems, and that’s good cause I know one that needs killin’. The same one as you want dead I’ll wager: a great-big, fire-breather. Calls herself Dagnir the Terrible. She ran me and my boys out of our home in Gundabad months ago when she came on us in the early morning.”\n“Gundabad!” exclaimed one of the adventurers. “The Goblins stole Gundabad from the Dwarves ages ago. Serves”\nharder to keep it,” laughed Urdug. “It belongs to the Goblins now.”\n“From your own account, it sounds like it belongs to Dagnir,” replied the hero sharply.\nUrdug stopped laughing and glared at her. “For the moment,” he said coldly. There was a tense pause before he laughed bitterly and continued, “I imagine she’s made herself a nice bed of treasure in the great hall by now. Probably made the Goblins drag it all up from the deeps for her.”\n“Goblins yet live there with the Dragon?” asked one of the companions with bewilderment.\n“Cowardly maggots!” Urdug exclaimed. “Lost their nerve at the first sound of her roar. Some fled south while others threw down their weapons and begged for mercy. Pah!” he spat. “I let out with the few who stayed loyal, but they’re mostly dead now. We fled out the secret door. The rising sun burnt our eyes, but we kept on. We came this way looking for a new home, but all we found was more Dragons.”\nUrdug regarded the Dragon carcass under him. “This one ate five of my boys after we stumbled into her cave.”\nOne of the heroes turned to her friends and said, “If all this is true, then we need to journey to Gundabad and find this Dagnir before she grows restless of her new home.”\nThen, turning back to Urdug she added, “And you, Urdug, will be our guide.”",

You’ll have to kill me.”\n“Very well,” replied one of the heroes as he drew his dagger from its sheath.\n“Wait, wait, wait!” cried Urdug, falling to his knees. “There’s another way! A secret way only Urdug knows! If you kill me, you won’t find it!”\n“What secret way?” asked the hero with his knife to the Goblin’s throat.\n“There’s a side door, a secret entrance that the Dwarves built – only I know where it is,” said Urdug, speaking quickly. “You can’t simply walk into Gundabad through the front door; Dagnir will be on you in an instant with her fire-breath. But I can show you the hidden entrance, if you untie me.”\nThe hero looked searchingly at Urdug. “I don’t like it,” he said. “How do we know you’re telling the truth?”\n“There’s a key.” replied Urdug, “I took it with me when I fled, but I lost it days ago running from an angry giant. Help me find the key, and I will give it to you as proof.”\nThe Goblin held out his hands, still bound together, and looked at the heroes pleadingly.\n“The Dwarves are known to build secret entrances to their realms, and a key would be convincing proof,” said one of the companions.\n“We should wait until we have evidence of his truthfulness before releasing him,” replied the hero with the knife.\n“But he insists he would rather die than aid us as our prisoner,” said the first. “We cannot carry him down these mountains, or drag him across Rhovanion, but I believe there are enough of us to keep an eye on him to watch for any sign of betrayal.”\n“Very well,” answered the other hero, sheathing his dagger. He narrowed his eyes and looked suspiciously at Urdug while untying him. “We will help you find this key,” he said, “and you will take us to your secret entrance. But be warned: if you attempt any deception, I will slit your throat.”\n“Yes, yes,” said Urdug rising to his feet, “Urdug will find you the key, and maybe the horn I lost as well. Perhaps even my friend, Tiny. I think he escaped when the giant attacked us. He was never too bright, but he knew when fight and when to run. Anyway, off we go. Follow me!”\nAnd with that, Urdug led the bewildered heroes down the slopes of the Grey Mountains to retrace his steps through Wilderland.",

But Urdug they kept alive because they still needed the location of the secret entrance to Gundabad. They bound him again with cords, and this time the Goblin did not complain. He didn’t even so much as whimper. Urdug had taken his chance to escape and failed. He knew that if he caused any more trouble for the adventurers that his fate would be the same as Tiny’s.\n“We have the key to the Goblin’s door but it is still a long way to Mount Gundabad, and we are ill supplied for such a journey,” said one of the heroes.\n“Agreed,” said another. “There is a great settlement of Woodmen between us and the mountain. It rests on the edge of Mirkwood Forest. Hrogar’s Hill, they call it. People are friendly there – though perhaps not to Goblins.”\nHe threw Urdug a sharp glance, but the Goblin did not even raise his eyes to see.\n“Excellent,” replied the other hero. “Then we head for Hrogar’s Hill.”\nThe heroes packed their things and began the long trek to the Woodmen settlement, leading their captive by a rope tied to his wrists.",

        "flavorIntro": "Hrogar’s Hill was a Woodmen settlement with a tall, wooden palisade that encircled it. The wall was built upon an earthen rampart and surrounded by a deep moat. A single, wooden draw-bridge connected the town to the road that led to its gate. Watch-towers were built on either side of the gate and guards kept their vigil there day and night.\nAt the far end of town opposite the gate, was the hill from which the settlement took it’s name: a tall, steep slope ascended by a fortified stair, and upon its summit was built Hrogar’s Hall. The Woodmen gathered there for important meetings and celebrations. If the town were to be overrun, they could take shelter there and long withstand a siege, for the Woodmen always kept supplies stored within.\nDuring the day, the Woodmen worked in the pastures and gardens that surrounded the town, or felled trees at the edge of Mirkwood forest nearby. But at night, they withdrew inside their walls and raised the draw-bridge as protection from dangerous forest-dwellers and Goblin raids. So it was that the heroes found the entrance barred when they arrived a few hours past sunfall on a dark night.\n“Who goes there?” called a guard from one of the watch-towers.\n“Travelers on an errand from King Brand in Dale,” answered one of the heroes. “We seek food and shelter for the night, and we have gold to trade for supplies.”\n“That is good,” replied the guard. “The servants of King Brand are welcome in our town, though it is long since any have visited. But what is that you bring with you?” He pointed to the Goblin whose wrists that had bound with rope.\n“This is our captive,” answered the hero pulling Urdug into the light with a tug of his rope.\n“The Master will not like that,” said the guard. “We have had many battles with the Goblins, but we are not accustomed to taking prisoners. For what purpose do you bring him here?”\n“That should not be answered in the open. Let us in, and we can speak more plainly.” said the hero.\n“Very well,” replied the guard, “I will summon the Master. Wait there.”\nAfter a little while, the draw-bridge was lowered and a small troop of armed guards ushered the companions through the gate where they were greeted by the Master; a big man with a bushy, white beard and keen eyes. He regarded the heroes with a friendly smile and said, “Welcome friends! What brings you to Hrogar’s Hill?”\n“We are on an urgent errand to Mount Gundabad with this Goblin as our guide,” answered one of the heroes.\n“Strange tidings!” exclaimed the Master. “Gundabad is a name of ill omen, and to follow a Goblin there seems folly. Your errand must be urgent indeed to travel there in such a manner. Tell me friends, what need drives you thither?”\n“We hunt a great Dragon: Dagnir the Terrible. This Goblin claims she drove his people from their homes in Mount Gundabad,” answered the hero.\n“A Dragon?” laughed the Master, appearing relieved. “My friends, this Goblin has deceived you. There has not been a Dragon seen in this part of the world since time out of legend.”\n“Deceived we may be,” answered the hero, “but the Dragon we seek is real. Two of its spawn we have killed already, and we fear what their mother may do when she learns what has befallen her children.”\n“Two Dragons?” said the Master with a fresh regard for his guests. His eyes were wide with wonder. Then, he collected himself and said, “I must hear the tale of these deeds. Come, you will be guests at my table tonight and tell me your story. My guards will keep watch over your prisoner.”\nTwo Woodmen escorted a sullen Urdug away as the Master led the adventurers up the steep hill to Hrogar’s Hall. There the heroes were seated at a long table and food was brought to them. The Master sat at the head of the table and listened to all they had to tell until their meal was suddenly cut short by the sound of alarm from outside.\nThe heroes followed the Master out of the hall where they saw in the distance a terrifying red-orange glow that cut a swath through the black night as it moved toward the town below. Dagnir had come.",
        "doNotRead": "As the first cold light of dawn climbed over Hrogar’s Hill, it revealed the smoldering remains of the Woodmen town. The city gate was smashed, and the watch-towers on either side were burnt to the ground. Inside the blackened walls, houses were still burning or already collapsed into scorched ruins. Yet atop the steep hill, Hrogar’s Hall still stood. The women and children had taken refuge inside during the attack, and a large part of the people survived thanks to the gallantry of the defenders.\nThe heroes had driven back the Dragon, but only after she had grown tired of hundreds of stinging arrows and sword strokes. No weapon had been able to pierce Dagnir’s thick armor enough to do her any real harm. When she reatreated into the night, it was only because she had grown tired of smashing homes, and her fires burned low.\nThe companions were not surprised when the Master emerged from Hrogar’s Hall and asked them to leave at once. Even if he knew better, many of his people accused the heroes of bringing the Dragon to their town. Some noted that there were Goblins who joined Dagnir in her attack and suspected that they were trying to rescue Urdug.\nAs it happened, their captive was nowhere to be found.\nAt first they suspected that his guards left him to fight the Dragon. That was until they found their bodies in an alley. One had a dagger in his back, and the other a slash across his throat. Without their Goblin guide and without the means to defeat Dagnir, the heroes had to rethink their plan. Here the Master provided them with a parting gift, a bit of lore to help them on their journey.\n“Until last night I thought Dragons were merely legend, but now that I know they are not, I am reminded of another story: the tale of a mighty warrior who slew the great worm, Scatha. It was rumored that he wielded an enchanted blade powerful enough to pierce the Dragon’s hide, and it was afterwards called ‘Wormsbane.’”\n“Such a weapon would surely aid us in our quest. Tell us: where can we find it?” asked one of the companions.\n“That’s easy,” answered the Master. “The man who wielded the sword was named Fram, and he won such great renown that his people named their city after him. Search for his resting place in Framsburg.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Thousands of years ago, Scatha the Worm attacked the Dwarves of Ered Mithrin and amassed a great hoard from their treasuries. He was one of the greatest Dragons in the Third Age of Middle-earth and the scourge of Wilderland, but even more renowned was Fram son of Frumgar, for he it was that slew the worm with his sword and claimed its treasure for his own.\nFram was lord of the Eotheod, and he used his wealth to improve the capital city of his people, which they afterward named Framsburg in his honor. It was rumored that the Dwarves demanded Fram return the treasure Scatha stole from them, but he refused. Instead, he made a necklace from the Dragon’s teeth and gave it to them with these words: “Jewels such as these you will not find in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by.” It is said that the Dwarves were so angered by this rebuke that they slew Fram in revenge.\nIn the years that followed, Eorl the Young would come to lead the Éothéod and bring them south to Rohan, whereafter they were known as the Rohirrim. Their old capital of Framsburg was abandoned and fell into ruin, and the tomb of their hero, Fram, lay hidden for millennia.\nIt was in Fram’s tomb that the heroes now hoped to find his legendary sword, Wormsbane. After their battle with Dagnir at Hrogar’s Hill, the adventurers learned their weapons were not sufficient to kill the Dragon. They hoped that the enchanted blade of Fram would be able to slay the beast. So they had traveled west from Hrogar’s Hill until they reached the river Anduin, then they followed the river north to Framsburg.\nThe ruins of the old city lay at the meeting of the Greylin and Langwell rivers. The Greylin ran down from the Grey Mountains to the north, and the Langwell flowed from the Misty Mountains to the west. When they joined, they formed the headwaters for the mighty Anduin that flowed far south where it served as a wide barrier between Gondor and Mordor, but here in the north the heroes were able to ford the river without too much trouble.\nOnce across, the adventurers made straight for the old keep. Age had taken its splendor and given it a haunted look, and in the failing light of the setting sun, the keep stood above the decayed remains of the dead city like a dark sentry, foreboding an evil fate for any who disturbed the memories of those long past. For a moment it seemed to the heroes that a faint blue light could be seen from a high window, but when they looked again the window was a black hole.\nA hush fell on the company as they walked along the ancient road that led to the keep. They neither saw nor heard any sign of danger, yet their hands rested anxiously on their weapons as a feeling of dread grew with each step they took towards the dark hold. They walked in silence, their eyes darting this way and that as if expecting some sudden assault, until at last they reached the gate. Its empty archway stood open like the black mouth of some horrible beast, but they could see nothing inside.\nThey lingered there for a moment until one of the companions spoke: “I like not this place. There is some evil afoot here.”\n“I feel it too,” said another, “Yet the sword we seek lies within.”\n“I fear what else we will find,” answered the first.\n“As do I. Let’s find out together,” came the reply. “Come. Follow me.”\nTogether the heroes entered in the dark keep in search of Fram’s tomb.",
        "doNotRead": "Beneath the haunted keep of Framsburg, in the dark of Fram’s tomb, the heroes were confronted by the shade of Fram himself. He regarded the heroes with lifeless eyes and the walls shook when he spoke: “Why do you come here? Have you come to steal my treasure? You cannot have it!”\nSuch power and terror was in his voice that the heroes staggered and could not at first respond. The dead man howled with rage, and again the cave trembled. It seemed that he would attack when one of the companions managed to speak: “Wait! We don’t want your treasure! It is a sword we seek. Wilderland is again threatened by a mighty Dragon, and we need your sword to defeat it.\n“Lies!” shouted Fram. “You want the gold from Scatha’s hoard, but I won’t let you take it!”\n“No my lord!” answered the hero. “There is no treasure left in Framsburg. It has been abandoned for millennia.”\n“What? What trickery is this?” asked the shade, its voice losing some of its terror. “Where is my gold?”\n“I know not,” replied the hero. “We found naught but this as we explored the keep,” he said holding up the Dragon-tooth necklace.\n“Ahh!” cried the shade as if pained by the sight. “The necklace! I remember!” His lifeless eyes were fixed on the necklace as he spoke: “When the Dwarves heard Scatha was dead, they sent emissaries to demand their gold be returned, but they were haughty and I disliked their manner, so I gave them the necklace and naught else. With mocking words I threw it at their feet, thinking little of their wrath.”\n“Then it was your pride that doomed you to this fate,” spoke the hero.\nThe shade seemed to contemplate this before it continued to speak: “Pride? Perhaps so. I thought that I had nothing to fear from the Dwarves. I had just slain the great worm, and they were guests in my house. But I underestimated the fire that burned within them. I thought them only a stunted people, but they set upon my guards in the night and slew me in my own keep.”\n“It was an evil death, my lord,” the hero said, “but it would seem that you brought this curse on yourself by provoking them.”\nFram’s ghost appeared to diminish further with its reply, “You are right; it was pride and greed that doomed me to this fate. I will bear it no longer.”\nFram lifted his eyes from the necklace to regard the heroes, and as they looked back at him they no longer saw a powerful shade, but instead it seemed to them that an old, wizened man stood before them.\n“You may have my sword. It lies within,” he said, pointing to the sarcophagus at the center of the tomb. “I repent of my arrogance. Forgive me.”\nWith those words, the shade of Fram closed his eyes and a peace washed over his face before he disappeared. The companions stood silently for a moment before opening his sarcophagus. Inside was the dusty skeleton of the fifth lord of the Éothéod. Chain mail hang from rotted bones, a crown rested atop its skull, and across its chest laid Wormsbane - broken in two pieces.”",

They paused atop a high hill to take one last look at the forgotten city, and it seemed to them that in the gentle light of the rising sun the old keep no longer held any menace.\n“Farewell, Fram son of Frumgar,” spoke one of the heroes. May his spirit finally rest in peace,” another intoned.\n“I would rest easier if we weren’t on our way to confront a giant Dragon with a broken sword,” one of their companions complained. “I can’t believe we went through all that trouble for a splintered blade!”\n“It was a disappointment to us all,” said one, “but we must I find a way nonetheless.”\n“Find a way?” came the reply.“ How are we going to fight Dagnir the Terrible with a broken sword? Throw it at her?”\n“We reforge it,” answered the first, ignoring the jab.“ Legend holds that Durin, father of Dwarves, awoke to this world in Mount Gundabad. According to his people, Durin built his first forge within the mountain and there taught his children the craft of metal work. So we bring the shards of Wormsbane and find the First Forge.”\n”This just gets better and better,” laughed the second. “First we find a broken sword, then we carry it into Dagnir s lair to fix it, while she what - waits politely for us to reforge it? What if she finds us before we're done? Let's not forget about the Goblins in her service that still ive in the mines!”\n”These are the hazards in our path,” agreed the first, ”and we will risk all of them to save Wilderland from Dagnir's wrath”\nShe looked at her disgruntled friend with compassion, but she spoke with determination: “You saw what she did to the Woodmen’s town at Hrogar’s Hill, and you know how much worse it might have been if we had not been there. We must endure whatever dangers lie in our path to prevent more suffering. We have the skill to repair Wormsbane and the courage to wield it. All that is left is to find Durin’s forge. Are you with me?”\n”Aye, of course I'm coming with you. That’s why I dislike this plan so much!” laughed her companion. “Let’s not forget we still have to find Urdug’s secret entrance,” he added.\n”I have not forgotten. Indeed, I believe I know where to look for it,” she answered, smiling at her friend. ”You remember the Goblin's account of how he escaped the Dragon? He used his secret route to escape Dagnir's assault, and fled into the daylight-toward the rising sun. That means the hidden door is on the eastern face of the mountain. The door may be camouflaged but the path leading to it is not. No doubt Urdug and his Goblins left a trail in their hurry to escape.”\n”Very well,” replied her friend, ”then there is naught else for us to do but get on with this folly. Let us hurry before I regain my senses.”\nWith that the heroes resumed their march to Mount Gundabad.",
        "doNotRead": "The blade of From son of Frumgar bit deep into Dagnir's chest and the Dragon bellowed in pain. Her roars shook the walls of the great hall, and her mighty tail smashed against a tall pillar, toppling it. As she thrashed about in her death throes, Wormsbane was wrested from the hero who dealt the final blow. Then, the giant Dragon toppled over the edge of a deep chasm and disappeared into utter darkness.\nDagnir the Terrible was dead and Wormsbane lost to the world forever, but all about the heroes lay the glittering treasure of Gundabad. Piles of gold were scattered here and there by the Dragon's death spasms, and now the entire hall was lit by the sparkling reflection of torch-light on shimmering jewels. Such a wealth had not been imagined since Erebor was recovered from Smaug the Golden.\n The companions clapped each other on their backs and started rummaging through the treasure. One of them opened his travel pack and was stuffing as much gold as he could fit inside when his companions laid a gentle hand on his shoulder.\n”Easy friend,” spoke his companion. “Others need this gold more than we.”\n”But surely there is enough here for us as well?” complained the adventurer with a pack full of gold.\n“Indeed,” answered his companion with a smile, ”but let us learn from Fram's example and not be greedy.”\nThe adventurer looked at the gold spilling out of his pack and sighed, “Aye. You’re right. The people of Hrogars Hill will need this wealth to rebuild their town.”\nHe stood and emptied the gold from his bag, when from outside they heard a horn blast. The heroes stopped what they were doing and listened. Another horn blast rang out.\n“I know that horn,” said one of the heroes in a grim voice. ”Urdug,” said another.\nThey drew their weapons and rushed to the gate. A full moon was overhead, and below them they saw Urdug astride a mighty Warg blowing his horn. About him was a large force of Goblins making their way up the mountainside. Mount Gundabad was under siege.",

        "flavorIntro": "Before leaving the Shire, Bilbo Baggins left his entire estate at Bag End to his nephew, Frodo, including the magic ring he discovered on his adventure. After his uncle’s departure, Frodo was visited by the wizard, Gandalf, who suspected that Bilbo’s ring was in fact The Master Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron for the dominion of Middle-earth. When Gandalf threw the ring into Frodo’s fireplace, ancient runes appeared on the band that confirmed it was indeed The One Ring, an ancient and indestructible evil.\nKnowing that servants of the Enemy would be searching for the Ring, Gandalf told Frodo he must leave the Shire and take the Ring to Elrond in Rivendell. He advised Frodo to sell Bag End and act as if he were moving to Buckland to avoid drawing suspicion before the wizard himself left to seek help.\nGandalf promised to return, but danger has arrived sooner than he expected: Black Riders have appeared in the Shire looking for “Baggins” and the Grey Wizard has yet to be seen. Frodo knows he can't wait any longer. He must move quickly and quietly if he hopes to make it to Buckland alive...",

Afterwards, the wound Frodo received at Weathertop was treated and he and his companions were given a long respite in the House of Elrond.\nYet the threat of Mordor still remained and the Dark Lord's power continued to grow, and the question of what to do with The One Ring had to be addressed. So the Council of Elrond was summoned and the fate of Middle-earth was long debated.\nIn the end, it was decided that the only hope for the enemies of Sauron was to send The One Ring back to Mordor, to the mountain of fire where it was forged. Only there, at the Cracks of Doom, could the Ring be unmade and the Dark Lord's power destroyed.\nFrodo Baggins of the Shire was chosen to carry out this task, and Elrond appointed companions to accompany him on his quest.

The border sentries of The Golden Wood rescued the Company from the Orcs and led them to Caras Galadhon, the city of the Galadhrim at the heart of the forest. There, on a wide flet set high among the tall mallorn trees of that land, Frodo and his companions were presented to Celeborn and Galadriel, the lord and lady of Lórien.\nThe Elves already knew of the Fellowship’s quest, and the weary companions were sheltered in Lothlórien long enough to regain their strength. Celeborn furnished the Company with boats to take them down the River Anduin, and Galadriel blessed each member of the Fellowship with a unique gift before they said farewell to Lórien.\nWhile the boats greatly aided their progress south, the Company was divided over which side of the river they should finally go to. Boromir of Gondor urged them to keep to the west bank and continue south to the city of Minas Tirith where his people prepared for war with the Dark Lord. But in Frodo’s heart he knew the path to Mount Doom lay on the eastern shore, under the shadow of Mordor. Yet none of them knew that Orcs already prowled both sides of the river, some bearing the Red Eye of Sauron, and others the White Hand of Saruman...",

So it was that Gandalf led Aragorn, Théoden, and the riders of his house to Isengard to parlay with Saruman.\nBelieving Isengard to be beyond the strength of his enemies to assault, Saruman had committed nearly all of his forces to the attack on Rohan. Yet, there was an ancient power that the Wizard had failed to account for in his schemes. The trees of Fangorn Forest had suffered much from the axes of Isengard Orcs, and the slow burning anger of the Ents was almost ready to explode.\nThe coming of Aragorn’s lost companions to Fangorn Forest with news of Saruman’s treachery was just the spark the Ents needed to rouse them from their inaction. After hearing about Saruman’s part in the great events unfolding in the world around them, the leader of the Ents, Treebeard, called an Entmoot to urge his compatriots to war.\nIn their anger, the Ents had the strength to tear down the walls of Isengard and destroy Saruman’s war machines. Still, Saruman was a cunning Wizard. Even when caught off guard, he had many dangerous powers at his command, especially his voice, which could daunt all but the most strong-willed individuals.

Still, Frodo was determined to finish the task given to him by the Council, and he made ready to set out when Sméagol pleaded with him to go a different way, a secret way known only to him.\nWhile Sam was suspicious of Gollum's true motives, Frodo believed that Sméagol would keep his promise to help them. In either case, there was no chance of entering Mordor through The Black Gate, so the Hobbits consented to follow Sméagol south to the Morgul Vale and the entrance to the secret pass.\nTheir road led them into the land of Ithilien, a wooded country of tree-covered hills and fast-running streams. The wholesome air of the land about them put the Hobbits at ease, and they were caught off guard when they were suddenly joined by a company of Gondorian Rangers who patrolled those woods.\nThe Rangers were on a mission to ambush the men of Harad who were marching up the road to Mordor to swell the hosts of Sauron. Before they knew it, the Hobbits were caught in the middle of a battle of men, and Gollum was nowhere to be seen...",

Orcs issuing from The Black Gate overran the island fortress of Cair Andros, and the main host of Mordor marched forth from Minas Morgul led by The Black Captain, The Witch-king of Angmar.\nDenethor, Steward of Gondor, sent messengers to King Theoden in Dunharrow to ask for all his strength to ride to Minas Tirith, and the beacon fires were lit between Gondor and Rohan. Meanwhile, men from the outland fiefs of Gondor marched in to Minas Tirith to bolster the city’s garrison. Yet, they sent less strength than hoped for because of the Corsair threat to the coastlands.\nSo it was that The Witch-king found the men of Gondor not wholly unprepared for the assault, but still greatly overmatched by the host of Mordor. On the eve of the attack Mount Doom belched fire, black clouds darkened the sky, and night fell on Minas Tirith. Unless help beyond hope could reach the White City in time, Gondor would surely fall...",

The giant Spider, Shelob, was mortally wounded when it cast itself upon the Hobbit’s Elven-dagger, and Gollum was driven off empty-handed.\nYet Gollum’s betrayal still came at a heavy price. Frodo was stung with Shelob’s poison and Sam, believing himself to be the last surviving member of the Fellowship of the Ring, took the burden upon himself to continue the quest for Mount Doom alone. He had not gone far, however, when a troop of Orcs discovered Frodo’s body and he overheard surprising news: Frodo was not dead! The sting that poisoned him would eventually wear off, but when he awoke he would find himself a captive of the Orcs.\nHorrified by this revelation, Sam determined to rescue his master and followed the Orcs to the tower of Cirith Ungol. When he reached the outer wall, he was surprised to hear the sounds of fighting inside. It seemed that the Orcs were quarreling over what to do with their captive. Encouraged by this new twist, Sam plucked up the courage to enter the fortress alone, but first he would have to get past the Silent Guardians...",

There Gandalf advised that they should not wait for Sauron’s next move, but rather they should ready their armies to march upon Mordor itself in a desperate gamble to keep his Eye fixed on them.\nThough he had not yet claimed the kingship of Gondor, the attending lords nontheless agreed to follow Aragorn’s banner to the Black Gate of Sauron’s realm if it meant giving the Ring-bearer the time he needed to complete his quest. So it was that only three days after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Host of the West marched from Minas Tirith towards Mordor.\nYet they marched without hope of victory. Each man knew that their army had not the strength to challenge Sauron in earnest. Rather they hoped to draw Sauron’s forces out of his land and clear the way for Frodo and Sam to finish the last leg of their journey to Mount Doom.\nAs the Hobbits made their way across the Black Land, Aragorn led his army north to the Morannon. There he raised the standard of Elendil and challenged the Dark Lord himself to come forth and face judgement.
