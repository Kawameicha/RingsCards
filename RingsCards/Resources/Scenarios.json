This may seem confusing at first; it is simply to ensure the proper number of cards are in the encounter deck for the number of players in the game.\n\nAfter being instructed to remove 4 copies of the ’Sacked!’ card from the encounter deck, players are asked to shuffle 1 copy of the ’Sacked!’ card per player back into the deck. Since there are 5 total copies of ’Sacked!’ in the deck, the end result of this is that the game begins with 1 more ’Sacked!’ card in the encounter deck than the number of players in the game.\n\n**Immune to Player Card Effects**\n\nThe Carrock, a location card in the encounter deck, has the text ”Immune to player card effects.” This text means that players cannot select The Carrock as the target of any card effect, and that The Carrock ignores the effect of any player card that would directly interact with it.\n\n**Ally Objective Card: Grimbeorn the Old**\n\nIn this scenario, players may encounter an ”ally objective” card, Grimbeorn the Old. If Grimbeorn is revealed from the encounter deck during the quest phase, he enters the staging area as an objective. If the players claim Grimbeorn the Old (as instructed by his card text), he becomes an ally under the control of the first player. The first player may then use Grimbeorn in the same manner he would use any ally he controls. If Grimbeorn the Old leaves play for any reason, the card is placed in the encounter discard pile.",

(They must also place the single progress token on the quest card itself to do so.)\n\nThis may seem to be an impossible task for some players, but the Emyn Muil locations in the encounter deck have victory points, and this allows the players to collect these locations as they are explored. Because of this, the locations will not be going to the encounter discard pile, from which they might resurface later in the game. So remember to collect the victory points, and eventually, the entire Emyn Muil region can be explored!",

These tests represent Gollum’s attempts to escape their pursuit.\n\nTo make an escape test, a player first commits characters to the test. A character must exhaust to commit to an escape test. Each committed character counts its [willpower] strength for the test. After committing characters to the test, the players may take actions or play event cards. If a single player is required to make an escape test, only that player may commit characters he controls to the test. If the party is required to make an escape test, all players have the option of committing characters they control to the test.\n\nOnce the characters are committed, a number of cards (as instructed by the card text dictating the escape test) are dealt from the encounter deck. Many of the cards in this encounter deck have a bold “Escape” value. Any card that does not have a printed escape value is considered to have a base escape value of zero. When dealing cards for an escape test, ignore all other effects on the dealt cards. Once these cards are dealt, the total committed [willpower] is compared to the total dealt escape value to determine if the escape test is passed or failed.\n\nIf the total committed [willpower] is higher than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is passed, and nothing happens.\n\nIf the total committed [willpower] is equal to or lower than the total dealt escape value, the escape test is failed, and the players follow the instructions for failing the escape test from the card that required the test be made.\n\nAfter an escape test, all cards dealt for that test are placed in the encounter discard pile.\n\n**Reset the Quest Deck**\n\nWhile playing this scenario, players might be instructed to ”reset the quest deck to stage 1B.” To do this, the players take the previously defeated stage 1 quest card, and return it to the quest deck as if they are just beginning that stage. Since the quest deck is resetting to stage 1B, the setup instructions on side 1A should not be followed again. Any progress tokens that were on the current quest are removed before the quest deck resets. Progress tokens that were on the active location, however, remain on that location.

These cards are placed away from the playing area and do not interact with the game until East-gate is explored, which will add First Hall to the staging area. Exploring First Hall will then add Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the staging area.\n\n**Cave Torch**\n\nThis scenario uses the Cave Torch objective card. The first player selects any hero to attach it to, and that hero will bear the Cave Torch for the rest of the game. If Cave Torch would leave play, either through a card effect or due to the hero it is attached to leaving play itself, then it is removed from the game. When a card is removed from the game, it should be set aside and ignored for the rest of the game. Do not place any ”removed from game” cards in the discard pile, as effects that bring cards back from the discard pile no longer interact with these cards.\n\n**Immune to Card Effects**\n\nThe location East-gate has the text, ”Immune to card effects.” This means that East-gate cannot be selected as the target of any card effect, and it ignores the effect of any card that would **directly** interact with it. The only way to place progress tokens on it is by questing, and once East-gate is the active location it remains the active location until it is fully explored (even cards like Dreadful Gap or Strider’s Path would not be able to move it to the staging area).\n\n**Revealing Enemies**\n\nEnemies that are dealt as shadow cards are not considered to be revealed from the encounter deck, and do not trigger the forced response on side 2B of the quest card The Fate of Balin.",

If the card does not have ”**PASS**” printed in its text box, then the player has not succeeded, but may attempt the test again, repeating this action until either the test is successful or he no longer wishes (*or is able to*) discard more cards. If a player runs out of cards or declares that he is not willing to discard any more cards to the test, then the test is considered a failure, and players should follow the rest of the instructions on the card that initiated the test.\n\n”**Lost:” Effects**\n\nSome cards have ”**Lost:**” effects on them.

This encounter set will be shuffled into the encounter deck at a later point in the scenario.\n\n**Creating a Staging Area**\n\nWhen instructed to ”Create your own staging area,” each player sets aside an area in front of himself to serve as his own private staging area. Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the First Player (which continues to move), but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently present in the game.\n\n ∙ Players cannot affect players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player’s threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\n\n ∙ During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 4 players have been separated, each player would add 1 card to his staging area.\n\n ∙ Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area. For example, if an effect references ”each player,” then that effect only refers to each player that shares the staging area to which the encounter card would be added.\n\n**Joining Another Player**\n\nOn stage 4B players are instructed to ”join another player” after completing their current quest card. Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase. The joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in his own staging area to the staging area of the player(s) he is joining with, keeping any enemies engaged with him and discarding any active location in the staging area being left. If multiple players complete their current quest card during the same phase, they join quests starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise around the table. If there is no player to join, then players must continue to stage 5.",

        "flavorIntro": "Having escaped from the Drúadan Forest and witnessed the demise of the conspirators by the arrows of the Woses, the heroes have begun their journey back to Minas Tirith. In the morning of the second day, they awoke to a grim sight. Dozens of columns of smoke were rising across the hilly farmlands of Anórien.\n\nIt seems death had crossed the Anduin after all.\n\nAs our heroes warily approached the nearest of the fires, they came upon two farmers hiding in the hedges. The frightened bondsmen told of roving bands of orcs scouring the countryside, bringing destruction to the defenseless herdsman and farmers of the surrounding lands. They told of a particularly cruel group that assaulted the nearby village during the night. They feared the villagers were dead.\n\nApproaching the village, the heroes saw signs that the citizens may not have been completely helpless. Several orc bodies lay crumpled in the streets, and a crude barricade of horse carts and earth-covered hay bales protected the town’s inner square. Only the buildings on the outskirts of the town seemed to be sacked and burning.\n\nAs the heroes approached the barricade, the villagers eyed them suspiciously, their expressions wavering between mistrust and hope of assistance. Smoke lay in a thick haze in the streets, reddening eyes and shortening tempers.\n\nWhat appeared to be a nobleman and his escort of guardsmen were helping the villagers with the defenses and in caring for the wounded and burned. They seemed haggard and tired from the night’s fighting. As the heroes approached, the sooty and weary nobleman squinted through the acrid haze at the newcomers, his hand moving to his sword. Then, as a faint gust of wind cleared the air for a moment, the nobleman broke into a wide grin of recognition. It was non other than Lord Alcaron.\n\n“Out of the west comes hope unasked for,” he called. “May I be the first to say that you are well met indeed!”\n\nAfter a brief greeting, Lord Alcaron grimly told the heroes of the plight into which they had fallen, and how he had been sent northward about a month ago on the realm’s business. Denethor had deemed it wise, in case Cair Andros should fall, to raise the levy of Anórien and prepare for the evacuation of the northlands to the safer side of the Rammas Echor. Upon receiving news of the victory at Cair Andros, Alcaron disbanded the levy, and for the past week or so has been seeing to the Stewards’ business in the region.\n\n“Alas” he grimaced, “even as the the victory of Cair Andros held back the tide of Mordor, the defeat must have left a substantial number of the enemy trapped on the western side of the river.” Alcaron sighed, “One would think those vile creatures would seek to return to their master by any means possible.”\n\n“No such luck. Instead they’ve come west to punish the local countryside, burning and murdering where they go”. Alcaron went on to tell of how the roads of Anórien had quickly become far too dangerous for traveling. Even with an armed escort, Alcaron was forced to seek the tenuous security of the present village.\n\n“A large group of the enemy has descended on the lands surrounding the Amon Dîn,” he continued, gesturing at the great hill that dominated the northern skyline. “They’re led by a particularly nasty captain who calls himself Ghulat.” He spat out the ugly name and pointed at the barricades. “We barely held them here last night. I don’t think they were expecting any resistance.”\n\n“The enemy will not make that mistake again.” Alcaron wearily glanced at a group of tired villagers leaning against a nearby wagon, armed with harvesting scythes and hayforks. “I didn’t like our chances of surviving another night.”\n\nHe turned to the heroes, a wide smile breaking across his sooty face. “Now that you’re here, I find cause for hope. Maybe we’ll save this village yet. What do you say?”",
        "ruling": "**Rescued Villagers and Dead Villagers**\n\nWhen setting up the Encounter at Amon Dín scenario, stage 1A instructs the players to put both the Rescued Villagers and Dead Villagers objective cards into the staging area. These cards represent the ultimate fate of the villagers being attacked by Ghulat and his orcs. During the game scenario effects will place villager tokens on Rescued Villagers and damage tokens on Dead Villagers. In order to win the game, the players will need to collect more villager tokens on Rescued Villagers than damage tokens on Dead Villagers.",
        "doNotRead": "Ghulat is dead and the village is safe. In the death and ruin, a stoic Alcaron reminds you of how much worse a punishment these lands would have suffered should Cair Andros have fallen. Even as the villagers bury their dead and begin repairs, the wives bring out their best foods and tablecloths to celebrate the village’s survival, and to give thanks to their saviors. As you feast, the distant fires seem much diminished. You hope this is a sign that local populations elsewhere are also managing to overcome the marauding hands.\n\nLord Alcaron proves a pleasurable companion on the return road to Minas Tirith. He beams of pride in the countryside, extolling the history of Anorien and of how the ancient walls of the Rarnmas Echor were built by Denethor’s father, Ecthelion the Second. Alcaron points to where great efforts are underway to repair the old defenses. “Gondor will never fall,” he exclaims, “not as long as its people live their lives in defiance.” He avoids looking east, the flicker of doubt in his eyes betraying the bravado of his words.\n\nAs the towers of Minas Tirith rise into prominent view under the white peak of Mount Mindolhuin, a group of riders carrying the banners of Gondor come upon you on the road. As they approach, you see they are soldiers of Gondor in full plate, their faces serious and intent upon their task.\n\nThe captain of the company approaches, nodding respectfully as he recognizes Lord Alcaron. “The Steward is calling the Pelennor to arms” the captain says. “With the enemy repelled at Cair Andros, Lord Boromir takes advantage of their disarray and we move to to retake Osgiliath.” He gestures east. “I am to send all able swords to join Lord Boromir’s forces.”\n\nAs the soldiers continue north, Alcaron shrugs. “I guess the feather beds and sweet wines of Minas Tirith must wait a few days more.” He turns his horse to take an eastern roadway. “Lord Boromir is not one to be kept waiting.” He stops for a moment and looks questioningly at you, patting the pommel of his sword. “Able swords? I do hope we can ride together for a few hours more, friends of Gondor.”\n\nYou glance east, where the black peaks of the Mountains of Shadow are crowned in a sullen haze of grey cloud. It seems Gondor has not finished with you yet...",

In the long war against Mordor, control of Osgiliath has been a critical piece. One that Boromir means to reclaim.\n\nAs the sun breaks over the Mountains of Shadow, beating at the still river fog, the great horn of Gondor sounds from Boromir’s lips.

To represent Gondor’s struggle to drive the enemy from every last corner of the ruined city, the players are instructed to take control of **Osgiliath** locations when they leave play.\n\nStage 1B reads: ”**Forced**: When an **Osgiliath** location leaves play as an explored location, the first player takes control of that location.” To take control of a location, the first player removes all progress from the just explored location and places it in front of him in his play area instead of discarding it. Locations under any player’s control are still in play. Their game text is active and they can be affected by card effects.\n\n**Losing Control of Locations**\n\nThe more **Osgiliath** locations the players control, the harder the encounter deck will fight back. There are many encounter card effects that force players to return locations they control to the staging area. Also, many of the **Osgiliath** locations have triggered effects that will cause players to return them to the staging area.\n\nWhen a player returns a location he controls to the staging area, he loses control of that location and removes all progress from it. If a player is eliminated from the game, each **Osgiliath** location controlled by that player is returned to the staging area.",
        "doNotRead": "The battle finally comes to an end.\n\nFor a while there is silence. There is no clanging of weapons, no thuds of arrows, no screams of pain. Just silence, breathing, and exhausted stares. The bodies of men and orcs litter the streets and waterways of Osgiliath, carrion debris scattered by a hard wind.\n\nYou pry your fingers from weapons sticky with blood, shoulders aching from forgotten strokes.\n\nThen the Horn of Gondor breaks the silence in triumph. The banner of the Stewards is unwrapped from the top of the white river bridge. The primal cry of victory that follows begins with Boromir, his sword held high in the air. The cry grows, until you inexorably join it. The sound of it, the exhilaration of it, vibrate the marble pillars around you. It is the sound of victory, older than the city, older than the river that runs through it.\n\nA claw of the enemy has been cut and it has retracted. He was repelled at Cair Andros, and His hold on Osgiliath has been broken. In the eyes of the men around you, you see the light of Númenor awoken. Gondor’s first sons, Faramir and Boromir, and Boromir especially, are worshipped by the men like the scions of old returned. It is a great day.\n\nThat night, Lord Alcaron and Lord Faramir find you in the merry glow of the campfires. Alcaron is exhilarated and enthusiastic, Faramir reserved. “We won’t stop here,” Lord Alcaron exclaims and points eastward into the darkness. “Tomorrow we follow them; we hunt them.” He smiles and clenches his fist. “We don’t stop until their black bones break on the mountains.”\n\nFaramir sits down by your fire, looking weary. “Our Lord Alcaron has convinced my brother we should pursue the enemy into Ithilien” he says calmly. He reaches for a stray stick and starts to rummage absently in the fire, his eyes distant. “We leave at first light.”\n\n“Ithilien will be ours again!” Alcaron doesn’t let Faramir’s solemn demeanor reduce his spirit. “We’ll be at Sauron’s doorstep, rather than he on ours.” Faramir glances at the excited nobleman, visibly uncomfortable with the Enemy’s name spoken so casually. Alcaron doesn’t seem to notice. “We’ll hold the southernroad. We’ll bleed him!” He grabs Faramir’s shoulder. “And whom better to take and hold that realm than the one who knows it best?” Alearon smiles at Faramir, hoping to recruit his enthusiasm. Faramir doesn’t bite.\n\n“This goes against my advice,” Faramir says, “but my brother wills it, so I go.” He tosses the stick into the flames and rises, eyes still on the fire. “Gondor owes you a great deal, friends of Gandalf” he says, his eyes meeting yours.“I cannot ask you for more than what you ve already given.” For the first time this evening, his lips turn to a faint smile. “But I would be honored of your company once more, should you grant it.” Faramir nods as he leaves. “I ride at early dawn.” He steps beyond the light of your fire and you soon lose sight of him in the labyrinth of campfires that surround Osgiliath this night.\n\nLord Alcaron claps his hands once and stands, his smile wide. “I ride with Faramir and his rangers tomorrow!” He pats each of you on the shoulders and follows Faramir, his request unsaid.\n\nIt wasn’t a difficult decision. You soon find yourselves in the darkness before dawn assembling with Faramir’s men at the eastern edge of the city. As the first band of light grows above the Mountains of Shadow, Alcaron notices you. He grins and winks anenthusiastic welcome.

        "flavorIntro": "In a great victory for Gondor, the city of Osgiliath has been retaken and the river Anduin is once more under the Steward’s control. Alongside the Lords Boromir, Faramir, and Alcaron, the heroes fought bravely to recapture the ancient city.\n\nWith the defeated forces of orcs and evil men retreating eastward, Lord Alcaron had urged Boromir to pursue the scattered enemy. “Don’t let a single one of them return to foul the Pelennor again!” Alcaron pleaded. “We should hunt them. Pursue them until their black bones break on the mountains.” Flush with the confidence of victory and swayed by the nobleman’s passion, Boromir agreed and asked his brother to take on this endeavor with his rangers. Faramir reluctantly consented.\n\nBy the request of Faramir, our heroes joined the incursion. The morning after the fall of Osgiliath, the company of rangers began their foray into the autumnal forests of Ithilien.\n\nIn the days that followed, the rangers managed to track and destroy a number of enemy mobs. Their carcasses were left to the elements: skeletal warnings to those of Mordor who would cross Ithilien again. It was late afternoon on the third day before the company came to the old crossroads near the foothills of the mountains.\n\nFaramir walked at the head of the column, our heroes and Lord Alcaron close at heel. As they came to the crossroads, Faramir crossed to the old statue that stood sentinel over the silent junction facing west. Alcaron moved to follow, but Faramir waived him back.\n\nThe stone figure, which must have been an impressive sight to those traveling the roads long ago, depicted a king of old seated on a throne. The years had softened its features, moss and lichen growing in its crevices and cracks. Rude scrawls and rough carvings had been made by hostile hands, defiling its stonework. The head of the statue had been knocked off, replaced with a crudely hewn stone. A coarse drawing of a grinning face with a single eye had been painted in red on the stone. The crowned head of the old king that lay to the side was curiously unmarked. It seemed the grass was greener where the head had fallen.\n\nAs Faramir reached the statue, he gently touched the stone as if greeting an old friend. He then knelt by the fallen face and sat for a moment. He rose slowly, carefully eying the road and surrounding terrain. No enemy had been seen since the evening before, a fact that troubled him. Above, grey clouds pressed close, and a light rain had begun to fall. In the late afternoon light, the forest seemed to have lost its color; ashen and sullen it seemed to watch their every movement in the exposed space.\n\nThen a look of decision crossed Faramir’s face, and he thoughtfully returned to the company. “We’ve taken this folly far enough,” he said. “There is an unkind change in the forest.” He paused a moment, glancing into the trees. “The lands so near to the Morgul Valley have been under His sway for too long. It’s unsafe to proceed.” Alcaron moved to protest, but Faramir would not abide. “My brother will have to be satisfied with the work done so far. We return to Osgiliath.”\n\nAs the company turned westward for their return journey, the silence of the forest broke in the blast of a distant horn. The sound rose and fell like some wounded brass bird. A chilling drone that promised nothing good.\n\nSuddenly, the woods all around the rangers came alive with the rushing black shapes and cruel blades of the enemy. An imposing robed figure led them, and the charging orcs gave him a wide berth. Though his face was mostly hidden by the cowl of his dark-grey robes, the man emanated terrible intent. This was no ordinary ambush.\n\nLord Alcaron screamed a brave challenge as he drew his sword. Faramir and his hard-eyed rangers simply pulled their blades in a steely whisper and waited for the onslaught to come.\n\nThe fight joined like a thunderclap...",
        "ruling": "**Hidden Cards**\n\nThe Blood of Gondor is a two stage scenario that puts the players in the middle of an ambush at the Crossroads of Ithilien. Hidden cards are encounter cards placed facedown in a player’s play area that represent the forces of Mordor waiting to attack the heroes. To this effect, both stage 1B and 2B have the same line of text: “At the beginning of the quest phase, each player takes 1 hidden card.”\n\nWhen a player is instructed to take 1 hidden card, he takes the top card of the encounter deck and places it facedown in his play area without looking at it. If there are no cards in the encounter deck when a player is instructed to take 1 hidden card, then he must shuffle the encounter discard pile back into the encounter deck and place the top card of the encounter deck facedown in his play area.\n\nIf a player is eliminated, any hidden cards in his play area are discarded.\n\n**Turning Hidden Card Face-Up**\n\nWhen a player is instructed to turn his hidden cards faceup, he turns each hidden card in his play area faceup one at a time. If a player turns a hidden card faceup and it is an enemy, he immediately engages that enemy. If a player turns a hidden card faceup and it is a treachery or a location, he immediately discards that card.",

Should a son of the Steward be taken by Sauron, then Gondor’s joy of such achievements would turn to ash in its mouth.\n\nNight falls over Ithilien as you follow the tracks of the Uruk that took Faramir and Alcaron. You run where possible, and hurry when not. Your eyes constantly move from the ground to the darkness ahead, hoping to catch a glimpse of your quarry.\n\nAs you near the dread valley of Morgul, the vegetation is increasingly dead or corrupted. The faint smell of decay lies upon the lands, growing stronger with each step eastward. Soon the moon appears above the Mountains of Shadow, bathing the landscape in soulless light. Though the illumination gives you no comfort, you are thankful for its help as you follow the signs of the Uruk. Of all your dangerous errands, of any defiance to Mordor that you may have shown in the past, this is a task you must not fail!\n\nThe dying vegetation slowly gives way to flinty rock and hardened dirt. The signs of the Uruk captors grow fresher, and you sense they are close. You run alongside the tepid, foul-smelling stream of Morgulduin that comes out of the Morgul Vale itself its stony banks receding eastward into the deepening shadows. As you proceed, you begin to feel the presence of Mordor before you, like a physical weight that taxes you to stop and flee. Tendrils of despair begin to grip your hearts as you remember the stories of this place. Yet still you move on, ceaselessly, inexorably. Ahead, you can feel the baleful presence of Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery.",

During the ensuing fight, both Lord Faramir and Lord Alcaron are captured.\n\nAt the thought of Denethor’s son in Sauron’s torture chambers, the heroes begin a desperate pursuit. Following frantic hours of tracking, they find themselves at the mouth of the dread Morgul Valley.\n\nAs the Dead City comes into distant view, they have come upon their quarry at last.\n\nSeeing their pursuers close behind, the breathless Uruk are visibly frustrated. They growl angrily as they halt to confer. A hooded figure in their midst, undoubtedly their leader, calmly directs the vexed orcs. He reminds our heroes of the Morgul sorcerer who led the ambush back at the crossroads. Even while that malefactor lies dead on the forest floor, they don’t relish the thought of facing another of his kind.\n\nThe truth is worse. Much worse.\n\nThe robed figures decisively gestures at the distant tower, his demeanor brooking no debate. The tallest of the Uruk submissively throws a man-sized bundle over his shoulders. Grunting for two of its kind to follow, the Uruk starts a brisk pace eastward. The robed figure is clearly not about to risk his trophy on the doorstep of Mordor.\n\nAs the breakout group moves down the ancient cobblestone road, the remaining Uruk turn to face the approaching heroes. As they enter earshot, the robed figure casually claps his hands and starts to laugh. The sound is hauntingly familiar.\n\n“You’re incurable!” he exclaims. “Why won’t you just die!” He raises his arms in mock frustration as the Uruk pull free their weapons in a rusty cacophony. Their eyes glow with bloodlust.\n\n“Fortunately, you are entirely too late” the robed figure continues. He casually gestures back at the tall Uruk pacing eastward toward the ghastly city. The bundled shape of a prisoner bobs on its ironclad back. “Sauron shall have His prize.” A cloud washes away from the moon as the robed man pulls back his hood “Nothing can stop that now.”\n\nA sickening heartache roils the heroes. Time seems to stand still as the depth of the betrayal hits them. The sickening corpse-light of Minas Morgul seems brighter. The waters of the Morgulduin gurgle in cruel amusement.\n\n“It should be natural, that one as old as I should have mastered patience,” says Lord Alcaron, whose real name is Ulchor. “Yet your persistence has tested me. Congratulations!” He continues, lowering his arms dramatically. “My master wanted both the brothers, but it seems I’ll deliver only the younger.” The traitor shrugs, “still, something tells me the younger is the greater prize.” Alcaron takes a moment to study the faces of his former friends. His smile seems to brighten at the horror he sees there. “Of course, I mean to deliver him your heads as well. As a consolation.”\n\nThe traitor nods to the largest of the Uruk. “I’m pleased to introduce my trusted servant Murzag.” As the traitor speaks he nods to the beasts. Murzag and his companions begin to move forward, licking their blades in anticipation. “I hope you’ll find his company eviscerating.”\n\nAs the Uruk charge the heroes, Alcaron casually turns and begins to walk toward Minas Morgul. His laughter echoes against the valley walls where unwholesome white flowers seem to drink the sound.",

Since the players are trying to rescue Faramir in this scenario, the objective reads: ”Remove Faramir from the game.” This means that no version of Faramir can be used by the players when playing this scenario.\n\n**”Captain” Enemies**\n\nThe Morgul Vale scenario has 3 stages, and a corresponding **Captain** enemy for each stage: Murzag, Lord Alcaron, and Nazgûl of Minas Morgul. To advance from each stage and win the game, the players must defeat each **Captain**. These tenacious enemies will stop at nothing to prevent the heroes from rescuing Faramir, and to that end each stage includes a line of text that prevents that stage’s **Captain** from leaving play unless it is destroyed. This means that card effects that would otherwise shuffle that enemy into the encounter deck or remove it from play will have no effect on the **Captain** at that stage.",

As if stirred in anger, the corpse-light of Minas Morgul pulsates slowly and ominously before you, like a funeral shroud in a warm wind. The undulating light reflects in the soudless white flowers that soudlessly seem to cry for your acquiescence in death.\n\nThe scream of the Nazgûl tears into the night air once more. A haunting ensemble of shrill flutes begins to play from behind the city’s bone-white walls. As the doors of the city open once more, something finally breaks inside you and terror takes hold. Dragging the barely sentient Faramir. you desperately flee westward as fast as your exhausted legs will take you. You never dare look back at Minas Morgul and the sepulchral procession spilling from its gates.\n\nIn the years that followed, you would remember little of the flight westward. It is a dim blur of barren mountainsides, rotten leaves, of the nocturnal forest and the haunting face of the distant moon above. When you now glance upon the full moon, you cannot help remembering the dread glow of Minas Morgul, and you shiver.\n\nAs the morning broke, a group of the surviving rangers found you slumped by the statue at the crossroads. They were not sure who was in worse condition, the wounded and beaten Faramir or his pale rescuers, unblinking and cold from horror and exertion.\n\nYou glance back from the saddle. Minas Tirith recedes into the distance and the Tower of Ecthelion, gleaming red in the sunset, seems to wave a final farewell.\n\nYou remember it all. The bear-hugs and gratitude from Boromir at Osgiliath. The careful ministrations in the Houses of Healing as your bodies mended and your minds forgot. The grand celebration in the court of Denethor, filled with flowers, smiles, and deep red wine. You I remember the Steward pledging the friendship of the White City. You remember words, and handshakes, and music. You recall the parting with Faramir, the endless gratitude in his eyes the most precious reward of them all.\n\nThen your eyes invariably move eastward, and your hearts sinks as you remember what you ve been trying to forget. The ambush. The brooding watchfulness of Minas Morgul. The cold terror of the Ringwraith. The treason of a friend.\n\nYou turn back and spur the horses on, toward the sunset, toward the Gap of Rohan. You feel comforted with Gondor at your back. By its strong, willful, and unyielding resistance to the shadow. You sense that you’ll see its green fields and white towers once more.\n\nUntil that day, other adventures lie ahead.",

Life had been hacked from his body with axes, nearly destroying the sigil of Rohan on his hauberk. Not far from him lay the remains of his horse, a proud Mearas slain by black-fletched arrows in its graceful neck.\n\nAs they dismounted to prepare a simple cairn for the body, a gust of western wind suddenly carried the familiar clangor of steel and screams. The dead man’s killers had found new victims.\n\nRain and aching bodies momentarily forgotten, the heroes remounted and urged their horses to speed.\n\nAs they cleared the crest of a long bracken hill, the landscape opened up to reveal the Gap of Rohan. Below them, fed by fall rains, the river Isen crawled south like a bloated serpent. The road descended the west-facing hill and led directly into the river where a ford bubbled and frothed among smooth-worn rocks.\n\nToday, blood and steel mingled with the waters.\n\nA small band of mounted Rohan warriors, knights of King Théoden’s household, were trapped at the center of the ford. From both sides of the river, scores of Wild Men from Dunland were attacking. Many of the Dunlendings brandished leather shields emblazoned with the crude sigil of an angry boar.\n\nWater rushing at the knees of their mounts, the knights were trying to protect an emissary in their midst. The nobleman was riding a grey mare and wore a black cloak. He flinched as the green shields of his protectors broke the deadly flight of the Wild Men’s arrows. Already, arrows had claimed two of the knights, their bloodied detritus floating among the boulders.\n\nThe Wild Men, tired of having their arrows deflected, began to charge. A few were already engaged in melee with the riders, but many were just now beginning to wade into the icy water with their shields raised as protection from the swords of the mounted knights.

They’d thought victory to be at hand, but a group of steel-willed strangers had appeared on the eastern ridge and brought relief to the hated men of Rohan. Denied of their prize, the remaining Wild Men retreated into the rocky highlands northwest of the ford. Their blue-painted faces screamed in fury back at the victors, their axes banging and pointing to the boar sigils on their shields with promises of revenge.\n\nThe remaining Rohirrim knights, exhausted but pleased at their renewed lease on life, greeted the heroes with bright smiles. The senior among them was about to speak when the dark-clad emissary kneed his mare forward. He was a young man with pale skin and inky circles under his grey eyes. Thinning wet hair matted his scalp in forlorn streaks and his black cloak clung to his body like dead skin.\n\n“Help unlooked for is help most obliged!” The emissary’s flat voice was one of accustomed authority, but its treble betrayed the terror he’d suffered during the attack. He shot a frosty look at the knight who’d been about to speak. “It seems Threol’s lack of vigilance did not doom us after all,” said the emissary. The senior knight whom the heroes guessed to be Threol cringed at the rebuke, smile forgotten.\n\nThe emissary returned his dark glance to the heroes, evaluating them.\n\n“I am Gríma, son of Gálmód, loyal advisor to Théoden King.”\n\nGríma pointed northwards where the valley of Isengard lay wreathed in rain and mist. In its midst, the spire of Orthanc emerged like a black nail hammered through a grey blanket.\n\n“I travel with a message to the White Wizard.” As Gríma spoke, he noticed that the river’s current had pushed the corpses of two Dunlending warriors into the shallower waters of the nearby bank. He shuddered. “We must be on our way.”\n\nThreol cleared his throat and spoke for the first time, his gratitude to the heroes outweighing his deference to Gríma. “The King surely will reward you for the bravery shown to us today.”\n\n“Of course, of course.” Gríma composed himself and eyed Threol with irritation. He circled his horse to study what remained of his escort. The councillor seemed as uncomfortable among the warriors as he did with the dead Dunlendings floating nearby. Gríma raised his pale face to the wind to study the hills, calculating the odds of another attack.\n\nAfter an uncomfortable moment, Gríma turned his horse to face the heroes again. “We would be...honored if you would come with us to Isengard,” he said. “Your protection would be appreciated.”\n\n“As would your company.” Threol found his smile again.\n\n“Saruman is a gracious host,” Threol continued, stealing a glance at Gríma with ill-hidden dislike. Threol was clearly embarrassed by the emissary’s self-serving behavior. “Warm food and dry beds must have appeal in this cursed weather, yes? Besides, I should dearly like to share a drink with those that saved our lives here today.”\n\nAlmost imperceptibly, Gríma inclined his head in agreement but said nothing.\n\nThe heroes accepted, and the group headed northwards into the low clouds, into the Wizard’s Vale.\n\nInto Isengard, home of Saruman the White.",

        "flavorIntro": "Saruman received Gríma and his escort at the steps of Orthanc. The strange black tower rose coldly from the midst of Isengard’s luscious gardens. It’s ebon walls seemed out of place among the greenery of the vale and stood in stark contrast to Saruman’s brilliant white robes.\n\nSaruman, somehow, had already known about the affair at the ford. He lavished praise on the heroes for their rescue, and reassured Threol.\n\n“The Dunlendings have grown daring of late, dear Captain.” The wizard spoke with a silky voice. It was a voice that enthralled, a voice that rung wiser than the wind, and its faint lilt was as encouraging as dawn itself. “Such an attack surely could not have been imagined until this ambush.”\n\nThe wizard’s servants took the company’s packs and horses, and Saruman led them up the steps into Orthanc’s great front hall. The walls were made of the same glassy black substance as the tower itself, generously hung with white tapestries and lit by delicate sconces. Fires from several braziers warmed the hall yet seemed to give off no smoke.\n\n“The clans have never forgotten their old feud with the people of Eorl,” Saruman continued, his voice reverberating in the great hall. “The clans fight amongst each other, and they all fight Rohan.” He spoke with sadness and regret “It is a shame such bravery and strength is wasted, when the days now darken in the east.”\n\nSaruman glanced sideways at the heroes, keen intelligence in his gaze. “I hope one day to convince the clans to unite their efforts.” Saruman smiled, and none felt untouched by it. “For the cause of our greater good.”\n\nOn their fourth day in Isengard, Saruman asked the heroes to dine with him. Neither Gríma nor the Rohirrim were invited.\n\nThey ate in the wizard’s elaborate private study. A great balcony adjoined the room, overlooking the great cobblestone courtyard that laid before Orthanc’s front doors. A late harvest moon shone through the balcony, white and wreathed in a ghostly halo. The food and wine was splendid, rivaling even that of Denethor’s table. Saruman ate little, preferring to talk and ask questions while sipping wine.\n\n“I sense you are under the favor and employ of my dear friend Gandalf the Grey,” he said after concluding a bout of questions on Gondor and the disposition of Ithilien.\n\n“You must know that we seek the same end, Gandalf and I,” Saruman continued, pleased with his guests’ comfort and attentive ears. “While Gandalf wanders, while he turns the rocks and douses small fires, I confine myself here.” The heroes nodded in appreciation as the wizard gestured proudly around his study. He sighed gently. “Here alone I study matters of the deepest significance. Of old things. Of such lessons as would help us face the rising shadow in the east.”\n\n“While Gandalf’s ways differ from my own, there is one thing we share in equal measure.” He smiled. “The need to retain brave allies—those of stout heart to face danger and hardship in our cause.” He toasted the heroes, and all seemed right with the world.\n\n“To that end, my friends, I ask you for your assistance, which I dearly hope you will choose to grant.” He steepled his hands, as if emphasizing what was to be said. He looked at each hero in kind, taking their silence as interest to learn more.\n\n“You already know the Orc threat has been growing in the mountains,” he continued. “In Gundabad, in Moria, near the high passes. Like the Wild Men, the servants of the enemy grow ever more aggressive.” He took a sip of wine, and his voice grew more intense. “In fact, one such band threatens the peace of this very valley.”\n\n“I am uncertain of the band’s numbers, but I know they are led by a particularly large and gruesome specimen of their kind—a chieftain who goes by the name of ‘Mugash.’” Saruman pursed his lips as if the word was bitter.\n\nThe heroes rose and spoke at once, proclaiming their willingness to destroy the Orc. Saruman waved them to their seats once more. “I am afraid it is more complicated than that,” the wizard sighed. “This chieftain, this ‘Mugash,’ has knowledge of his kin’s desires, of their movements, of their plans, and, most importantly, how they are receiving word from the east.”\n\nSaruman lowered his voice to a near whisper. “The task I request of you, is not to kill this specific Orc,” he curled his fingers to form a cage as he asked the impossible, “but to capture him.”",
        "ruling": "**The Out-of-Play Deck**\n\nWhen setting up To Catch an Orc, each player is instructed to set the top 20 cards of his deck aside, out of play.Those 20 cards become that player’s out-of-play deck.\n\n**Mugash**\n\nThere are 4 enemy cards in *The Voice of Isengard* that have player card backs: 1 copy of Mugash and 3 copies of Mugash’s Guard. These are encounter cards, not player cards, and cannot be included in any player’s deck. The reason Mugash and his guard have player card backs is because they are meant to be shuffled into the players’ out-of-play decks when setting up To Catch an Orc.",
        "doNotRead": "In hindsight, trapping Mugash was the easy part. Transporting the Orc back to Isengard was a problem unlike any the heroes had ever faced.\n\nAt first, they were pursued by angry remnants of Mugash’s band, often forced to halt and seek defensive ground. Yet worse than the pursuit was the journey itself. While fall storms ravaged the lowlands, early winter had come to the mountains. Gales of sleet made the path treacherous, and the wind willfully bit into every inch of exposed skin. Shallow ravines and steep rivulets, dry for most of the year, now gushed with ice-laden water. The nights froze, and every morning the stony slopes were coated in jagged ice.\n\nThey’d pried a staff beneath Mugash’s arms and bound his hands before him with thick rope. His legs had been forcefully bent and then tied together over another staff placed in the hollow of his knees. In this way, the heroes could drag the Orc or carry him by both poles when necessary.\n\nOn the first day of the return journey to Isengard, upon realizing his entrapment, Mugash had roared and yelled continually, spitting anger and snapping his fangs at his captors. His curses echoed in the mountainsides and encouraged the pursuers. After a day of listening to his screaming, the heroes had finally stuffed a piece of an old surcoat into the Orc’s fanged mouth. Using strips of leather, they tied the cloth so tight behind his head they heard his skull groan at the pressure.\n\nAt first, the gag seemed only to make Mugash angrier. It took another full day to traveling before he settled down somewhat, his breathing whistling angrily from frozen nostrils, eyes glaring at his captors with unvarnished bile.\n\nAfter three days, the pursuit finally stopped, but the weather turned for the worse. The winds howled along the cliff sides, and a mordant never-ending sleet left their faces raw and blistered.\n\nThere was little forage on the trail, and the heroes walked on slim rations. They dared not feed Mugash. Undoubtedly, he’d begin screaming again, and even if the pursuit had ceased, they didn’t want to chance its renewal.\n\nAs the heroes drew nearer to Isengard, Mugash became ill. His eyes, which were once alive with hate, became puffy and closed in feverish sleep. His nose leaked a blue-green sludge, and his breathing was reduced to a thin whistle. His dark skin had turned ashen grey, except where his limbs were pressed around the staves. There, it had bruised into a blackish purple. Mugash no longer struggled or grunted, and his weight seemed to have deadened.\n\nThat night, the heroes were troubled. They’d finally begun their decent into the lower passes and the weather had turned milder, but their prisoner seemed likely to die before reaching Isengard.\n\nReluctantly, they loosened Mugash’s bonds to improve his circulation. They removed the gag and forced hot wine and a paste of bonemeal into his foul mouth. The beast was burning with fever, so they placed him farthest from the fire near a boulder that blocked the worst of the wind. His breathing was so slight it could barely be perceived.\n\nThat night was the coldest of the journey, but the weather was clearing. A few stars could be seen in gaps between moving clouds and the sleet had paused. After choosing a sentry, the heroes huddled down near the fire and for the first time in their lives, they drifted off to sleep hoping that an Orc would not die.\n\nHours later, as the cloud-streaked moon dropped behind the south summit, the sentry thought he heard the scurrying of wolves down the mountainside. He rose to briefly investigate, but the darkness held nothing and he returned to the embers of the fire. As he settled, he no longer heard the Orc’s breathing, and so guessed the captive must have finally died. With a sigh, he rose again to investigate.\n\nIn the shadows of the nearby boulder, where he expected to see Mugash’s corpse, he instead saw scraps of cloth and rope. The two staves lay nearby; Mugash must have cunningly and quietly slid them inch by inch away from his body by pressing them against the boulder.\n\nMugash was not dead. Mugash had escaped.",

        "flavorIntro": "Mugash was free and running.\n\nThe sickness lingered in his body, but he savored its malevolent presence. Because of it, his tormentors had thought him near death and loosened his bonds. The fools had even fed him.\n\nMugash’s arms and legs stung. His joints were swollen and throbbing where the ropes had tied him to the poles. His limbs had been useless the first few miles of his escape, and he’d crawled like a worm down the mountainside, pushing himself forward with shoulders and hips. The great Orc had laughed at the pain.\n\nHis way, the way of the Uruk, was not one of stealth and silence, but last night on the mountainside, stealth and silence had been his closest friends.\n\nHe flexed his hands. Through the pain he felt strength returning. He had outwitted the hated bright-eyed humans, and now he was free.\n\nBut the humans, the bùbosh skai, were hunting him. He could hear their pursuing feet in the pass above him. He spat, tasting the stale rag that had been jammed in his mouth for days. When revenge came, he would feed hot coals to his former captors.\n\nAs Mugash thought of his imprisonment, a blood rage almost took him, but he resisted the urge to turn and fight. He knew the skill of these particular skalug, and fighting them now would be foolish. Mugash was no fool. He’d become chieftain of the southern tribes through more than strength and violence. Vengeance would wait. He’d fight another night.\n\nHow Mugash wished it was night! The sun had risen, and its vile sharpness was like a blade in his eyes. Even so, the great Orc forged on. He’d always prided himself on his resistance to the white eye. Though it hurt him, unlike most of his tribesmen—he endured its viscous glare. Even so, the bright path was hard to see and the pain was another tax on his punished body.\n\nHe’d thought of escaping back along the mountain path, but the ice would have slowed him further. Instead, he hobbled east, down the mountainside and eastward, into the damned rising white eye. Into the lower lands. Into the trees.\n\nAs the forest shadows shielded him from the sun, he grunted with relief. The southern forest, with its dense canopy of ancient trees, made for an almost-subterranean world, twilit in greens, browns, and blacks. He would have preferred a dark tunnel or cave, but this was not a bad place.\n\nThe great Uruk took a ragged breath and renewed energy came to him. He soon disappeared into the shadows of the primordial forest. It would be impossible for the bùbosh skalug to find him there.\n\nMugash soon learned he was wrong. This forest was, after all, a bad place.\n\nNot far behind, the heroes followed in close pursuit. They’d caught the monster once, and were determined to do it again. Yet even the strongest determination could not stop them from hesitating when they realized that Mugash had ventured into the old forest of Fangorn, a place with a dark and dangerous reputation.\n\nAs they entered Fangorn, the air hummed with a subtle song of branch and leaf, and the tune was unkind. They’d come to a place forgotten by the world and abandoned by time. One that wished to remain so.\n\nThe trees and stone watched, as they always had. A humid wind whispered in the branches, and old memories stirred in bark and root. Sleeping things woke from sour dreams. Things that hated disturbance. Hated the smell of change and steel and fire that clung to the intruders.",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "As the trees gave way to the boulder-strewn grasslands of the mountainside, their spirits revived.\n\nThe heroes had awoken the anger of ancient things with rotten hearts. They’d fought the crushing power of old roots and strangling branches and they’d barely escaped alive. Now those horrors were behind them.\n\nThe great Orc, Mugash, was their prisoner once more, and after another two days of traveling, they finally descended on the winding path that led into the Wizards Vale from the north. Orthanc greeted them coolly among the welcoming colors of the vale’s vegetation.\n\nSaruman was grateful for their help in capturing the Orc, and his rewards were generous.\n\nThe heroes spent the winter in Isengard, recovering from their ordeals in the mountains and forest. Yet, as the season passed, the heroes saw less and less of the wizard. He was often closeted with work in his chambers, and they sensed a growing frustration in him, as if the results were not to his liking.\n\nUpon seeing the telltale sign of summer birds returning north in the high skies, the heroes felt their northward journey must resume. Over a rare dinner with the wizard in his high study, they told him of their plans to depart the following morning. Saruman seemed displeased.\n\n“My work is unfinished, my friends,” he began as a servant refilled his goblet. The wizard sipped at the wine and continued. “The Enemy is wise, and he remembers such secrets of old that even the Elves have forgotten.”\n\n“It is of great consequence that we learn the depths of the Enemy’s measure and mind,” Saruman continued. “It is with knowledge of the past, and in the powerful weapons of yore, that I perceive our greatest chance.” He took another sip, considering his next words. “Did others not defeat Sauron and his master before? Should we not seek the old powers of Beren, of Gondolin, of Númenor?” The wizard leaned forward. A hungry, eager, light was in his eyes. “Of Isildur?”\n\nThe heroes gleaned the flaw in Saruman’s speech. If Sauron had truly been defeated, then how could he have returned to power? It seemed to them that weapons of the past had merely held the shadow at bay. They didn’t voice their doubts, however, for the wisdom in Saruman’s voice quickly dulled all qualms.\n\nSaruman continued his lecture. “I believe a long-lost place, one thought destroyed by the enemy, may have been uncovered in the hills of Hollin. It was among those hills that the great Elven city of Ost-in-Edhil stood, and it was there Celebrimbor and his apprentices forged legendary artifacts of good, unmatched in the world today.”\n\nSaruman’s back had straightened and he seemed to glance into the past, as if he saw the forge fires of the long-dead Elven masters. His voice became deeper and his bearing mightier. The heroes felt, rather than saw, the secret light of the Istari pulsing from him, like heat from a searing oven. “Is it not incumbent upon us to seek the tools and weapons of a better age?” It was not a question he expected the heroes to answer.\n\nAfter a few moments, his reverie seemed to recede and, his gaze returning to the dinner table. “Word has come to me from the north. A Dwarf by the name of Nalir claims to have found a hidden Elven forge near Hollin.” Saruman paused, as if hoping for a reaction from the heroes. When none came, he seemed slightly irritated. “Nalir is waiting in Tharbad and desires to sell the forge’s whereabouts for a substantial sum of gold.” Saruman’s intonation made it clear he valued the precious metal no more than the crumbs on his plate.\n\n“I believe this may be nothing less than the forge of Celebrimbor himself.” He folded his hands. “And it may prove a vital link to past strengths.”\n\nThe wizard now looked at each of the heroes in turn. “I know you wish to return to Rivendell,” he said. “I admire your dedication to Gandalf’s trifling endeavors. Yet I need your skills in exploring this place and procuring what it may contain.” The heroes shuffled uncomfortably in the seats. Their absence from the north had been long, and the grey wizard’s need was keenly on their minds.\n\nAs Saruman caught their hesitation, the enticement of his words seemed to magnify.\n\n“My friends, I ask you most kindly. Travel to Tharbad for me and procure the forge’s location from this Dwarf. Then reconnoiter the forge and recover its contents for me. Do this, and you may rejoin Gandalf with my blessing and eternal friendship.” Saruman’s shadow seemed to grow as he spoke, and the room felt suddenly small. “It is of greater importance than I can ask you to understand.”\n\nThere was a moment of tense indecision, then the heroes, one by one, gave their nods. As the reluctance ebbed, Saruman relaxed. He smiled sweetly, greeting their acquiescence with a statesman’s grace.\n\n“I knew you would not turn from duty,” Saruman said. His words seemed to stroke them as a master’s hand would his faithful dog. “With luck, your quest may help plant the seeds of a better age.”\n\nIt seemed their work for Isengard was not yet finished.",

        "flavorIntro": "In the circle of Isengard, the heroes were preparing themselves for the journey to Tharbad. The leader of the White Council, Saruman, had tasked them with an important quest: to find the hidden forge of Celebrimbor, the master Elf-smith who forged Rings of Power in the Second Age. The Wizard believed that knowledge of Celebrimbor’s secret forge could be learned from a Dwarf who they were to meet in Tharbad.\n\nThe heroes were tightening their belts and shouldering their bags when Saruman descended the stairs of Orthanc to wish them farewell. “This gold should be sufficient to convince the Dwarf, Nalir, to sell you his map,” the Wizard said as he handed a heavy purse to the heroes. “Guard it well. For the location of Celebrimbor’s forge is a prize beyond worth, and we dare not let the servants of the Enemy find it in our stead.”\n\nThe heroes added the gold to the bag of valuables that they had recovered from the Orcs of Methedras, then Saruman bid the heroes hasten and returned to his tower. The heroes themselves mounted their steeds and rode south from the ring of Isengard until they reached the Old South Road that would lead them to Tharbad where Nalir could be found.\n\nThe road ran west and north through the hill country of Dunland and they rode until sunset. As the red sun burned low in the distance, the heroes gathered around a fire to keep warm and ease the weariness in their limbs. But just as sleep began to close their eyes, they were startled wide open by the sound of war cries from all around. A host of bearded Dunlendings was swarming down the hills towards them with weapons drawn...",
        "ruling": "**Strategy Tip**\n\nThere are a number of effects in *The Dunland Trap* that trigger after a player draws a card. If several of these effects are in play at the same time, it can be difficult to keep track of them all. In order to manage multiple effects that share the same trigger, it can be helpful to keep this strategy in mind:\n\nAfter a player draws a card, check each encounter card in play for a **Forced** effect that triggers at that time. Then, resolve each effect before moving on.\n\nThis may cause the scenario to progress slowly at first, but as the players become familiar with the various **Forced** effects, the game will advance more quickly.",
        "doNotRead": "Wounded, exhausted, and surrounded by Dunlending spears, you brace yourself for defeat. But at the last moment, the leader of the Wild Men lifts his hand to halt the attack. “Wait!” he commands, his eyes focused on the baggage spilled on the ground. The large Dunlending bends down to lift a totemic amulet from the ground. As he holds it up to inspect it more closely, you recognize it as one of the artifacts that you recovered from the Orc’s lair in Methedras.\n\n“Where did you find this? Tell me!” the large war-chief demands, a mix of rage and wonder on his face. His composure becomes more thoughtful as he listens to the tale of your errand upon Methedras and your battle with the Orc, Mugash. He turns the amulet in his hand while he listens as if considering what to do. Then, with obvious reluctance, he gestures for the other Wild Men to lower their spears.\n\n”You are our prisoners now,” the fierce leader growls. With a jerk of his bearded head, he speaks a command to the other Dunlendings, and the heroes are bound and marched to the Wild Men’s village.\n\nUpon your arrival, the warriors escorting you are greeted by savage cheers from the other Dunlendings. Lifting a hand for quiet, the war-chief addresses his people. “The straw-heads took our land,” he says with disdain, “but the Boar Clan will reclaim what is ours!” Then, lifting the amulet in his hand, he adds, “As we have reclaimed this!”\n\nA quiet falls on the crowd and you can see looks of amazement on their faces. “This amulet belongs to the Boar Clan,” says the war-chief in a loud voice. Turning to face you, he continues, “As do you, and everything you carry.”\n\nAt his command, the other Dunlendings begin pawing through your belongings, until a shout of discovery catches the war-chief’s attention. One of his warriors hands him a small bag. “A rich bounty you have brought us,” he remarks, holding Saruman’s purse in his hands. To the your dismay, he turns it over, spilling a rain of precious golden onto the ground.\n\nAs the Dunlending women begin lighting bonfires for a victory feast, the Wildmen leader approaches you and speaks quietly, “Tonight, my people celebrate our victory.” He still holds the mysterious amulet in his hands, as if it were very precious to him. “Tomorrow, we will deal with you.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes were bound hand and foot inside a wood lodge of the Dunlendings. Outside they could hear the warriors of the Boar Clan celebrating their victory, when a large Dunlending entered. It was the leader of the war-party that assaulted them, and the same Wild Man who ordered them taken prisoner. He approached the heroes until he stood towering over them.\n\nThe war-chief stared intently at the heroes, holding the totemic amulet taken from their baggage. “I am Turch, chieftain of the Boar Clan. Every ten years, an amulet like this is given to a youth of great promise,” he began. “The gift marks the height of his manhood and signals his worthiness to undertake the three trials.”\n\nHis eyes grew distant, and for a moment sadness washed over his stern face. Then, with a deep breath he hardened his face and continued, “This amulet was given to my son.”\n\nAt that moment, an elder Dunlending man wearing ritual boarskins and the bones of his totem animal entered. “You would reveal our secrets to these strangers?” He asked in a sharp voice, indicating the heroes with a sweep of his arm. “They are not Boars!”\n\nThe chief glared at the druid, “I am the chief of this tribe! I will speak what I like.”\n\nThe old man fell silent and bowed his head. When the chief returned his attention to the heroes, he held up the amulet in his weathered hand and resumed his story, “Whoever succeeds at these trials will recover the Antlered Crown and unite our people. My son journeyed into the forest near the mountains to attempt the trials several years ago. He never returned.” The chief’s eyes were haunted when he met the heroes’ gaze. “No other youth showed such promise, and none of his peers dared to take his place. To my shame, the Boar Clan has no champions to undertake the trials when the moon grows full this night.”\n\nOnce again, the old man interrupted, shaking his fist towards the chief. “These strangers wear the trappings of our enemies! We dare not trust them!”\n\nThe chief held up a hand to silence the wise man and kept his gaze on the heroes. “I see now that my son was slain by the Orcs you encountered,” he said. “It is good that Saruman sent you to deal with them.” Then, scratching his beard thoughtfully, he spoke to himself, “The friendship of Isengard in addition to the Antlered Crown would force the other clans to recognize the leadership of the Boar Clan.”\n\nHe seemed to ponder that idea a moment. Then, turning his attention back to the heroes, he spoke to them, “You avenged my son by dealing with the Orcs that killed him, and you fought well when we ambushed you. I believe that my son’s spirit is with you.”\n\nThe chief looked down at the amulet one last time before reaching forward to offer it to the heroes. “If you remain here, my people will demand your death. Instead, it is my wish that you take the trials in my son’s place and retrieve the Antlered Crown. If you do this, you will be spared and free to continue the Wizard’s errand.”\n\nBefore the heroes could reply, the old druid pounded his staff on the ground and shook it violently. “You cannot do this! They are not Boars! They cannot undertake the trials!”\n\n“Consult the bones,” ordered the chief as he rose to his feet and towered over the old man. “Let the Boar spirit decide.”\n\nThe old druid reached inside his boarskins and reluctantly brought out a small purse. He opened the pouch to let the small bones inside it spill onto the ground, then he bent to his knees and lowered his face to inspect them closely.\n\nAfter a tense minute of silence, the old man grunted, and rising slowly to his feet he spoke slowly, “The strangers may undertake the trials.”\n\n“The bones have spoken,” spoke the chief. “It is decided then: You will undertake the trials to recover the Antlered Crown for the Boar Clan. Success will grant you and your master our friendship. Failure will grant you death.”",
        "ruling": "**The Current Trial**\n\nThe three stage 2 quests in this scenario (The Trial of Strength, The Trial of Perseverance, and The Trial of Intuition) represent three different trials that the heroes must complete in order to reach stage 3. The current stage 2 quest is referred to as the ”current trial”. Each trial has a different **Key** objective that must be claimed, which is chosen randomly during each stage 2A’s “when revealed” effect. The Key objective that is chosen during each stage is referred to as “the current trial’s **Key** objective”.\n\nEach stage 2B says “**When the players control the current trial’s Key objective...**” The “current trial’s **Key** objective” is the one that was chosen during the “when revealed” effect of that quest’s stage 2A.",
        "doNotRead": "Upon your return to the village of the Boars, you present the Antlered Crown to their chieftain, who accepts it with a wide grin. “You have done well,” he says holding his prize high to the wild cheers of his clan.\n\nAfter ordering a celebration, chief Turch explains the significance of the Antlered Crown to you, “This crown belonged to our king when we ruled the rich lands east of the river Isen. When the straw-heads drove us into these hills, our king died. We might have yet recovered our lands, but his three sons squabbled over who was best suited to lead and the argument divided us into three clans: Boar, Wolf, and Raven.”\n\n“Their fight nearly drove us to war with each other, but a wise shaman took the Antlered Crown and hid it in the woods where you found it and placed a curse on it. He told the three brothers that the one who was brave enough to retrieve the crown would be the one to lead our people, but none were successful. The spirits that guarded it were too strong.”\n\nThen with a surprisingly friendly smile and a clap on your back, the chief continues, “Yet where others failed, you have succeeded. And now the other clans must accept the rule of the Boar.”\n\nAt the celebration feast, chief Turch makes you honored members of the Boar Clan and returns your possessions to you. Last of all he returns Saruman’s gold. As he hands you the purse, he holds your hand and says, “We are grateful to you and your master for your aid. We will make sure that you reach Tharbad safely to continue the Wizard’s quest.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Looking at Tharbad, the heroes were dubious. The river town was little more than a haven of freelancers and highwaymen, filled with dilapidated buildings amongst ruined and crumbling causeways. As soon as they entered the ancient city, they inquired with several townsfolk to discover where they might find Nalir.\n\nIn due time, the heroes were pointed in the direction of a patched and ramshackle tavern, The Empty Mug. Once inside, the heroes found the Dwarf they sought sitting alone with a tankard of ale. His appearance did little to inspire confidence in the heroes, but there was a glint in his eyes when they spoke of the map that revealed a cunning mind at work.\n\n“Aye, I have the map you seek,” he said, wiping the ale from his mouth. “However...” he continued slowly, “I sold it to a man earlier today, name of Bellach. A shady looking character, he was. Not the sort of man to take ‘no’ for an answer. But he offered a fair price, even if he was foul about it. I’m to meet him here at sundown to make the exchange... Unless you can offer a better price?” Nalir punctuated his question with a sly grin.\n\nThe heroes were eager to purchase the map, and Nalir used it to his advantage. It took all the gold from Saruman’s purse to convince the Dwarf to sell the map to them, but in the end a deal was struck. “Done!” exclaimed Nalir, clapping his hands together. “A nice bit of business! Now let’s finish it quick before that Bellach returns. I’d like to be far from here before he finds out I’ve sold the map to you. I don’t imagine he’ll take the news kindly.”\n\nWith that, Nalir stood up from his seat and moved his chair aside to get at the floorboard it had been sitting on. He lifted the board and took a rolled parchment from underneath. “Here’s the map I drew. It shows the way to the hidden chamber in Ost-in-Edhil,” he spoke with obvious pride. “Lucky to find it, I was. Elves are right clever about hiding things they don’t want found. Another Dwarf might’ve walked right over it without ever knowing it was there. I daresay you’d never find it on your own! But now that you’ve got Nalir’s map, you don’t have to worry about that...”\n\nHe was just about to hand his map to the heroes when there was a shout from the doorway. A tall man in a dark cloak stood there. He had a cruel scar across his face and his right hand was on his sword hilt. Several more sinister-looking men stood behind him.\n\n“Bellach!” exclaimed the Dwarf.\n\n“Is that the map you sold to me?” demanded the man in the doorway pointing at the parchment Nalir was about to give the heroes. There was murder in Bellach’s eyes. “You have made a foolish mistake,” he snarled, then put his fingers to his lips and made a loud, shrill whistle. To the heroes’ dismay, it was answered by the unmistakeable sound of Orc shouts from outside the tavern.\n\n“Kill them!” Bellach shouted to his followers as he drew his own sword. “In the name of Mordor! Bring me the map!”\n\nNalir wasted no time fleeing for the back door as Bellach’s men rushed inside. A roar of shouts and clanging steel filled the little tavern. Just as Nalir reached the door, it was thrown open from the outside by a large Orc. The Orc seized the map that was in Nalir’s hand, but the Dwarf ’s grip was strong. After a brief struggle, there was a loud ripping sound as the map was torn in two.\n\n“You fool!” snarled Bellach at the Orc with half a map in its hand.\n\nIn that brief moment of distraction, the heroes saw their chance. Grabbing Nalir, they shoved past the bewildered Orc and sped down the alleyway behind the tavern, the sound of pursuit close behind...",
        "ruling": "**Threat Elimination Level**\n\nStage 1B of this scenario reads: “Time 4. **Forced**: After the last time counter is removed from this quest, lower each player’s threat elimination level by 10 for the remainder of the game. Then, place 4 time counters on this stage.” A player’s “threat elimination level” is the amount of threat at which a player is eliminated. This number is typically 50. However, in this scenario, a player’s threat elimination level may be lower than 50. If a player’s threat is ever equal to or higher than their current threat elimination level, they are eliminated from the game (see page 22 of the rules for **The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game** for more concerning player elimination).\n\n**Attacks Against Nalir**\n\nNalir is an objective-ally in Trouble in Tharbad.

You may have thrown off your pursuit for the moment, but its clear that Bellach and his minions have not given up the search.\n\n“Well now,” chuckles Nalir, dusting himself off, “that was a close one!” But his laughter dies in his throat when he sees the bemused look in your eyes. His expression becomes indignant and he raises his voice, “How was I supposed to know he was from Mordor? He looked Gondorian to me! It’s not my fault he tore the map!”\n\nAt that moment, an Orc shouts close to where you crossed the river “They’ve found our tracks,” whispers Nalir nervously. “It won’t take long to figure which way we’ve gone. With the map destroyed, I’m the only one who can find the hidden chamber, and Bellach knows it. He won’t stop looking for me so easy.”\n\nBellach will no doubt set a watch upon the road. You’re sure to be discovered if you go that way, but you still need to reach Hollin. As you consider your options, it seems the only course open to you is to enter the vast marshland of the Nîn-in-Eilph which lies close at hand. If you can find your way through to the eastern side, you should come out near to the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil and the completion of your quest.\n\nNalir frowns as you explain your plan to him. “Yonder marshland?” exclaims the Dwarf. “There’s no path through those fens. They’ve been undisturbed for ages. Nobody goes in there. I’m grateful to you for helping me out, but no amount of gold is enough to convince me to go wading through miles of stinking water.”\n\nJust then, theres’a loud splash followed by Orc cursing. The Orcs are making the crossing and getting closer.\n\n“On the other hand,” begins Nalir nervously, looking in the direction of the noise, “Orcs are more like to kill me than water. And besides, I owe you for rescuing me back there. So perhaps it’s best if I accompany you to Hollin...”\n\nWith that, you lead the Dwarf into the tall reeds of the Nîn-in-Eilph.",

        "flavorIntro": "With Bellach’s Orcs scouring the country around Tharbad looking for the Dwarf, Nalir, the heroes had chosen to flee with him into the Nîn-in-Eilph, a vast swampland that had been undisturbed for ages. By taking this path the heroes hoped they would throw the Orcs off their trail and come to Hollin on the other side. But after wandering for a day through the pathless marsh, the heroes were growing tired and Nalir’s complaints were getting louder.\n\n“I told you this was a bad idea,” Nalir grumbled as he struggled through the marsh and sank to his chest. “I don’t like to get closer to water than the riverbank. Dwarves don’t swim, you see.” Despite the roguish Dwarf’s protests, the heroes trudged on. The mission they had undertaken for Saruman to find Celebrimbor’s forge was important, and all the more urgent now that the Enemy was searching for it too.\n\nNalir, however, cared little for Saruman and less about his mission. He had only agreed to make the crossing with the heroes for fear of the Orcs, but there was something about the swamp that made him more afraid. As they slogged through the endless marsh, they began to hear noises like gentle splashes.\n\nA foul smell overtook the heroes and a sense of dread stopped them where they stood knee-deep in the swamp. Unconsciously, they drew their weapons and faced outward to see the murky water rippling toward them.\n\nNalir thought he saw a long dark shape snake its way across the surface. “There’s something out there,” muttered the Dwarf. The heroes strained their eyes but could see nothing through the fog that had settled over the swamp.\n\n“We can’t stay here,” said Nalir, trying to stay near the center of the group. “We’ve got to find a way out.”\n\nThe heroes knew he was right. Whatever dangers lurked in the Nîn-in-Eilph, the heroes would have to brave them in order to reach the other side...",

Then, the previous stage 2 is placed back in the quest deck with the other unused stage 2 cards. Any progress that was on that stage is lost. When the players are instructed to advance to a different random stage 3A, follow the same steps.",
        "doNotRead": "The fight amongst the fens is no easy feat: the swamp made for uncertain footing at best, and the creatures attacking you take ruthless advantage of the environment. Your battle cries echo strangely amongst the fens, and even the most practiced swordsman finds his blows robbed of momentum and grace by the muddy silt beneath your feet. However, your courage and skill carry the day, and you emerge triumphantly on the eastern end of the marsh. The strange denizens of the Nîn-in-Eilph withdraw back into the swamp and you shamble away in a pell-mell retreat.\n\nYou climb a low hill before stopping to rest. As you bind your wounds, Nalir pulls off his boots to pour the water out. “Just what I deserve for trying to take a shortcut through that cursed swamp,” he mutters angrily. Then, reluctantly he nods to you, “I owe you my gratitude again. I’d have never survived to make it this far without your help.”\n\nNalir stands up and looks around then points south and smiles. “Well, we only need to follow the River Glanduin there the rest of the way to the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil. Once there, I can show you the hidden door that I discovered.”\n\nOnce rested, you follow the Dwarf along the shore of the Glanduin. For days you walk through the land of Hollin, a pleasant but unpopulated region. “Long ago, this place was known as Eregion. A mighty realm of Elves, it was,” Nalir explains as he walks. “The city of Ost-in-Edhil was their capital, until the armies of Mordor burned it to the ground and all the Elves either fled or died.”\n\n“But that was an age ago,” sighs Nalir “We won’t find naught there now but crumbled buildings and...” The Dwarf’s words trail off as you crest a hill to see the the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil spread out below you. Among the toppled stones and cracked roads of the ancient Elven city you can discern the skulking figures of Orcs prowling about and the tall figure of a man giving orders.\n\nBellack has arrived ahead of you.",

        "flavorIntro": "Orcs were crawling over every stone and into every hole in the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil when the heroes arrived at the edge of the valley. From their vantage point, they could see the man, Bellach, as he ordered the search.\n\n“I should’ve guessed that scum would get here first,” hissed the Dwarf. “He must’ve led the Orcs here while we were lost in that swamp.”\n\nThe heroes looked on the scene with dismay. After all their travels, it seemed they had come too late to accomplish their mission. Then Nalir noticed something that made him growl, “He’s got the other half of my map with him! Look, he’s using it to direct the Orcs.” Suddenly the Dwarf started laughing, “That fool! He’ll never find the hidden chamber with just half. He’s searching in the wrong spot!”\n\nNalir’s news gave the heroes hope that they may yet discover Celebrimbor’s forge and recover its secrets before Bellach and his Orcs. However, the Dwarf had gone as far as he would, “What you do from here is your business, but with all these Orcs searching about, I daren’t go down there. If we’re seen by those Orcs, even warriors of your mettle may not survive.”\n\nThe heroes objected but it was clear that Nalir could not be convinced to lead them any further. “I’ll tell you where I found the hidden chamber,” said the Dwarf, “but I’m not going nowhere near that many Orcs. I doubt if anybody could make their way through that valley without being spotted.”\n\nNalir did his best to describe where the entrance to the hidden chamber was located before wishing the heroes luck and slipping away. He gave one last dubious look at the heroes before disappearing out of sight.\n\nTurning back to the matter at hand, the heroes look out over the vale of Ost-in-Edhil and try to discern the entrance to the hidden forge at the valley’s end. They would have to move with great stealth if they wished to evade Bellach’s forces and reach the end of their quest.",
        "ruling": "**The Orcs Search**The Orcs’ Search is an objective that represents the efforts of Bellach and his servants to discover Celebrimbor’s hidden forge and the heroes who search for it.

This is significant because The Orcs’ Search reads: “When a location has damage equal to its printed quest points, place it facedown underneath The Orcs’ Search.” When a location is placed facedown underneath The Orcs’ Search, it means that Bellach and his minions have searched that location, bringing them one step closer to finding the knowledge they seek and leaving the heroes fewer places to hide.\n\nOther cards besides locations can also be placed facedown underneath The Orcs’ Search by various encounter card effects. When the players are instructed to place a card facedown underneath The Orcs’ Search, they must first discard any tokens on that card and any attachments attached to that card. Facedown cards underneath The Orcs’ Search are not in play and only interact with card effects that specifically reference cards underneath The Orcs’ Search.",

The servants of Mordor sought to capture it, but by your courage and skill Bellach has finally been defeated and his Orcs scattered.\n\nYour companions fall silent as each of you gazes at this venerable relic of an earlier Age. The interior of the mould is lined with an inscription of flowing Elvish runes, perhaps written by the hand of Celebrimbor himself. If the ring-mould had been brought to Mordor, it would have surely given Sauron more strength. But in Isengard, there is hope that Saruman the White will be able to use the ring-mould to combat the power of the Enemy.\n\nEager to see this powerful artifact in the hands of the Wise, you begin your return trip to the Wizard’s Vale without delay. Keeping the Misty Mountains to your left, you journey towards the Old South Road that will lead you back to Isengard.\n\nA few days travel brings you back to the borders of Dunland.

        "flavorIntro": "The signs of war littered the hills of Dunland. Everywhere the heroes looked there was smoke and blood and fire. Across a wide valley, the bodies of Dunlending warriors lay slain in the dirt. Some wore the trappings of the Boar tribe, others were dressed with Raven feathers.\n\nAs the heroes searched the battlefield for survivors, they were alerted to an approaching troop by the tromp of marching feet. Looking in the direction of the sound, they descried the banners of the Boar Clan flying above an army of Wild Men. Striding proudly at the front was chieftain Turch wearing the Antlered Crown. He halted when he saw the heroes.\n\n“Well met,” said the chief with a smile. “I am glad to see you again, but you cannot travel any further; our country is at war.” His face was stern, but his eyes were weary.\n\nHe removed the Antlered Crown and wiped his brow, then regarded the thing in his hand and frowned. “The Antlered Crown has not united the Dunlending clans as I had hoped. The leader of the Raven Clan has rejected my leadership and laid claim to the crown for himself, instigating this fight.” The large chieftain spat in the dirt to show his disdain.\n\n“The cowards of the Wolf Clan have reserved their allegiance for the moment, but if they should ally with the Raven, I fear we will be overmatched,” he explained. Then, looking at the heroes he continued, “Yet, if the emissaries of Saruman were to ally themselves with us, the Boar Clan would surely be victorious! And you would return to Isengard with the friendship of a united Dunland. What say you?”\n\nThe heroes were reluctant to fight in the Dunlendings’ war. Yet, even if they refused, it seemed unlikely that they could escape Dunland unscathed. Better to fight alongside the Boar Clan than to flee into danger, they decided, especially if it meant they might earn friendship of the Wild Men for Saruman. Surely the threat of Mordor demanded that all free peoples unite together?\n\nSeeing an opportunity to strengthen the West, the heroes agreed to march with Turch and his clan.\n\n“Excellent!” bellowed the Boar chieftain. “Come, the Raven Clan is still scattered among the hills. We must find their chief before he gathers the rest of his clan to him. If we defeat the chief of Ravens, the rest of his clan will submit.”\n\nChieftain Turch placed the Antlered Crown back on his head and signaled to his men, “We march!”",
        "ruling": "**The Raven Deck**\n\nWhen setting up The Antlered Crown, the players are instructed to create the “Raven deck.” To do this, remove each enemy card in both the Dunlending Warriors and Dunlending Raiders from the encounter deck.

        "doNotRead": "Chieftain Turch leads the warriors of his clan in a victory shout, then turns to you with a wide grin. “The three clans of Dunland are united at last. Now that the Raven Clan is defeated, the Wolf Clan will support my rule and the Dunlendings will be one people again.”\n\nThe large Dunlending leans closer so that only you can hear what he says. There is real concern on his face. “It pains me to think that I fought against the servants of Saruman at our first encounter. Please tell your master I regret those deeds, and that I desire only friendship with Isengard. The people of Dunland are in his debt.”\n\nYou promise to share Turch’s words with Saruman when you return to Isengard. “Good,” says the chieftain, looking relieved. “I believe that the services you have done for the White Wizard shall long be remembered.”\n\nAfter parting with the Boar Clan, the remainder of your journey to Isengard is uneventful. Upon reaching the great tower of Orthanc, you are greeted by Saruman. The Wizard’s face displays a triumphant smile when he learns that you have been successful in your task.\n\n“Well done!” he congratulates you as you tell him of your journeys. There is a gleam in the Wizard’s eyes as he accepts custody of the ring-mould taken from Celebrimbor’s forge.\n\n“I shall examine this mould carefully,” he says. “I am certain a close study of this artifact will give the Wise new strength with which to fight the Enemy.”\n\nWhen you tell the tale of your encounter with the Wild Men of the Boar Clan, Saruman lifts an eyebrow and strokes his beard. “You have exceeded my expectations by earning the friendship of Dunland. This is an event of great import.”\n\nThe Wizard peers out a tall window of Orthanc, deep in thought. “An alliance between Isengard and the Dunlendings could bring an end to their age-long strife with Rohan, and bring order to this region. I will need to send an envoy to their chieftain soon: one who can speak for both Isengard and Rohan. Perhaps King Theoden will consent to send Gríma. He is deep in both our councils.” Turning back to you, Saruman’s pleasure in your accomplishments is evident. “You have done great things, my friends, and you have my gratitude,” he declares.\n\nAfter a couple weeks of rest, it is time to resume your journey north. Saruman accompanies you from his tower to the gate where the guards bring your horses to you. As you climb into your saddles, the Wizard gives you a parting instruction, “Give my greetings to Master Elrond in Rivendell, but pray, speak nothing of the ring-mould. The eyes and ears of Mordor are everywhere, and even the Wise are not safe. Better that it’s whereabouts remain secret.\n\nYou can see the wisdom in Saruman’s request and you swear to tell no one of your discovery. “Excellent,” he says, lifting his voice. “I wish you good speed in your travels. If you see Mithrandir, give him my greetings as well. Farewell!”\n\nYou ride out from Isengard and the gates close shut behind you. You have ended one journey, only to begin another. As you set out for Rivendell, you consider all your accomplishments and celebrate, if only for a moment, the great deeds you have done in Saruman’s service.",

        "flavorIntro": "The House of Elrond was bustling with preparations. Fall was turning the leaves on the trees of Rivendell to flaming colors, and the valley echoed with the singing of merry voices. The Elves were gathering the last of the summer harvest to celebrate the Autumnal Equinox. All were busy except the Master of the House and his guests, a band of weary travelers who had recently arrived from important errands in Gondor and Dunland. The heroes were tired from a journey of many leagues fraught with peril, and Elrond had welcomed them to rest in his home and tell what they could of their adventures.\n\nIn the Hall of Fire, Elrond spoke with the heroes at length concerning their service to the White Council. Many great deeds they had done to forestall the growing power of Mordor, and for their acts of valor, Elrond made them honored guests and bid them stay until they were refreshed.\n\nWhile they spoke with the Elf-lord, a messenger entered the Hall to announce another traveler newly come to Rivendell. Behind him stood a tall man of proud bearing. He wore the weather-stained garb of a Ranger. From the man’s appearance, it was clear that his errand was urgent.\n\n“Mae govannen, Dúnadan,” said Elrond, “The sons of Valandil are welcome in Imladris.”\n\nThe Ranger placed his hand over a hawk pendant he wore on a chain around his neck and bowed. “My lord,” he spoke, “My name is Iârion, and I have ridden here in haste to seek my kinsman, Aragorn. There is evil afoot in the untamed lands north of Bree, and we Rangers have need of our Chieftain.”\n\n“The son of Arathorn is not here,” answered Elrond. Gesturing for the Ranger to sit in the empty chair next to him, he continued: “But tell me more of your errand. Long have the Dúnedain kept the villages of Bree safe with secret vigil, yet seldom have they sought for aid in that thankless task. What evil drives you here now?”\n\nThe Ranger took the seat that was offered to him before explaining: “Orcs have been discovered west of the Weather Hills in greater number than we have seen them in many years. They are spying out the land, and we believe they plan to attack.”\n\n“Alas, Aragorn is far afield with my sons and the warriors of my house,” replied Elrond. “Until they return, I have no one to send to your aid.”\n\nIârion looked downcast but mastered himself before speaking: “Then I must return at once to my kinsman and help them prepare as best I may.”\n\n“I will tell your Chieftain of the threat to his people as soon as he returns,” said the Elf-lord.\n\nThe Ranger stood up, bowed to Elrond, and turned to leave, but the heroes who were sitting there rose to their feet and stepped forward. “We will come with you,” spoke one, and the rest nodded in agreement.\n\n“I thank you strangers,” replied Iârion. “But as Master Elrond has said, our deeds are secret and thankless; we Dúnedain receive no reward for our sacrifice, and neither do we have any to offer.”\n\n“Hunting Orcs is its own reward,” said the hero evenly, and continued, “we will not sit idle here while you and your folk fight this battle. Not while we have strength left. We will come.”\n\n“Then let us ride swiftly to the aid of my people,” said Iârion with fresh hope in his eyes.\n\n“May the favor of the Valar be upon each of you in this task,” spoke Elrond in farewell.\n\nTogether the Ranger and the heroes bade farewell to the Last Homely House. They rode west from the valley of Rivendell toward the villages of Bree-land. They followed the Old Road over the Last Bridge all the way to the southern end of the Weather Hills. There they turned aside to climb Weathertop, the tallest of the hills. Its summit commanded a great view of the surrounding area, and Iârion told his companions there would be Rangers keeping vigil there. From them, the Dúnadan hoped to learn some news before pressing on.\n\nWhen they reached the top, they found two Dúnedain who greeted them. “Ho, Iârion. I see you have brought others to help us, but I fear it may be too late,” one of them said grimly. “A large number of Orcs descended from the hills last night. A war party it seemed to us, but moving warily and avoiding the road. We watched them creep north and west along the edge of the marsh until they disappeared beyond the fens.”\n\n“It is likely that they mean to come upon the villages of Bree-land from the north,” replied Iârion looking in the direction the Rangers indicated. “Our people in Chetwood must be warned! One of you take my horse and ride with haste to do so. My companions and I will follow the Orcs and do what we can do to delay them.”\n\nTurning to the heroes, Iârion laid his hand on the pommel of his sword as he addressed them: “There are many lonely homesteads north of Bree. We must do what we can to track these Orcs and safeguard those people. Come!”",

        "doNotRead": "Iârion leaned on the hilt of his sword and watched the last of the Orcs flee to the east, away from peaceful villages near at hand. The Ranger and his company of heroes had chased their quarry to the very borders of Bree-land, where they forced their enemy to turn and give battle.\n\nThe war-party was better armed and better disciplined than the sort of ordinary rabble the Ranger was accustomed to hunting, but in hindsight it seemed clear to Iârion that the Orcs were bent more on pillaging than fighting, for they broke and fled after only a short battle.\n\n“Clearly these Orcs did not expect to be met by such determined resistance,” said one of the heroes triumphantly, looking down at the body of the last Orc they had slain before the rest turned to flee.\n\nRoused from his tired musings, Iârion turned to face them and replied gravely, “Yes, but the audacity of their attack unnerves me; the Orcs have not dared to venture this far west in years. What is it that leads them here now?”\n\nThe heroes could see the concern in the Ranger’s eyes, and the rush of victory faded as they considered the implications of his question.\n\n“I’m afraid our work is not yet finished, my friends,” said Iârion, gazing into the distance. “There is to be a gathering of the Dúnedain at Fornost in a few days to celebrate the Autumnal Equinox. I must go thither with news of this attack for I fear it is but a prelude of things to come, and the Rangers must be ready for what follows.”\n\nTurning to the heroes with him, Iârion continued, “However, we cannot allow those Orcs that fled to escape, or they may return again in even greater numbers. Since I must go to Fornost, I ask you: will you track them in my stead?”\n\nFrom the strained look in his eyes, the heroes could see how hard it was for the honorable Ranger to burden them with this dangerous task, so they made him an oath that none of the Orcs who had ventured so close to Bree would live to return again.\n\n“Well said,” replied Iârion. Then, he raised his sword in salute and spoke, “May the spirit of Oromë guide you on your hunt!”\n\nWith that, the Ranger sheathed his blade and hurried away. The heroes watched him head north along the Greenway for a minute before turning their eyes to the east and the trail of their enemies.",

        "flavorIntro": "For days, the heroes pursued the remnants of the war-party east from Chetwood across the northern edge of Midgewater Marshes and into the wide plain beyond. Along the way, they came upon several burnt homesteads. Each was plainly the work of Orcish savagery. However, at each home, the heroes were surprised to find no bodies. Instead, they found signs of struggle and the unmistakable tracks of Orcs dragging their captives away.\n\n“Why would retreating Orcs stop to take prisoners?” asked one of the heroes, examining the impressions on the ground.\n\n“Perhaps they think to ransom their lives?” answered another as they emerged from the charred ruin of a collapsed hovel.\n\n“One or two prisoners would have sufficed if that were their intent, but these Orcs have taken a dozen at least,” replied the first. “Look at the markings here.”\n\nThe hero in the doorway knelt by their companion to examine the earth more closely. After a minute they said, “I think I see the answer to this riddle: The Orcs we chase are not the same that attacked this home, though it is likely that they are in league with each other. Look here! The prints made by this family as they struggled against their captors are at least a full day older than those of the Orcs we have pursued here.”\n\nThe rest of the heroes agreed that they were right, but this discovery did little to ease the group’s mood since it suggested the attack near Bree was only part of a larger plot. There was a brief silence as each member of the company contemplated what that might be.\n\nAt length, one of them spoke, “If the Orcs are in league together, then it is likely that the ones we hunt will lead us to their meeting place. There we may hope to find those who were captured. Even if we cannot rescue them, we can at least avenge ourselves upon their captors!” The rest agreed that this was their only course of action, and they resumed the chase.\n\nThe Orcs’ trail led them north and east towards the Weather Hills. As they marched, the sky above them grew dark with clouds driven by a chill wind out of the north. By the time they reached the first rocky slope of the hills, it was unusually cold.\n\nThe heroes drew their cloaks about them, but it did little to keep out the frosty air. As freezing rain began to fall on the heroes, one of them lifted their eyes skyward and said aloud, “This is an ill omen, my friends. The weather turns against us and washes out our trail. I fear there is some new evil at work here that gives aid to our enemies.”\n\nThere was some murmur of agreement among the company before another spoke up, “It matters not whence the rain comes or if the trail ends; our quarry hides somewhere in these hills, and we must find them or forsake their captives and our oath.”\n\nThere was a hushed ring of steel as each of the heroes drew his weapon in silent reply. The heroes pulled up their hoods and began to search the hills for sign of the Orcs...",
        "ruling": "**The Orc Deck**\n\nWhen setting up The Weather Hills, the players are instructed to create the “Orc deck.” The Orc deck represents the scattered Orcs hiding among the Weather Hills that the heroes must find and destroy. To create the Orc deck, remove each enemy card with the Angmar Orcs encounter set icon, as well as all copies of Concealed Orc-camp, from the encounter deck and shuffle them into a separate deck. This is the Orc deck. When a card from the Orc deck leaves play, it is placed in the encounter deck discard pile. If the Orc deck is depleted, ignore any effects that refer to the Orc deck.",
        "doNotRead": "The Orcs had made their camp inside an old Dúnedain border-fort built at the northern edge of the Weather Hills in the Second Age during the war between Arnor and Angmar. The ancient wooden gates were destroyed with age and the Orcs could not stop their pursuers from entering in. Once inside, the heroes fulfilled their oath to Iârion by slaying every Orc they found hiding among the ruins.\n\nAfter the fighting was finished, the heroes cleaned the blood from their weapons and began searching for the Orcs’ captives. Inside what might once have been the great hall of the fort, they found the mutilated bodies of several villagers. Their desecrated corpses were arranged at the center of an evil pattern on the floor. The victims had clearly been sacrificed as part of some unholy sacrament, but none could guess what it was. Then did the heroes rue their decision to slay all the Orcs without questioning them first.\n\n“This is not Orc work,” said one of the heroes who looked with horror at the scene. “This is foul sorcery.”\n\n“Aye, but whose?” asked another in reply.\n\n“Let us search the rest of the fort in hopes that we may find the answer,” said a third, covering his mouth and turning his face away from the bodies.\n\nAt the far end of the hall, they found a darkened stairway leading down. The heroes lit a torch and descended the narrow passage as it twisted its way underneath the fort. At the bottom of the stairs they found a dank cellar sealed by a locked door. From inside they could hear the sounds of shuffling and whimpering.\n\nThe heroes forced the door open and thrust a torch inside. The flickering orange light revealed a small group of survivors huddled together in a corner. They appeared half-starved, and they shivered in the cold dungeon. The heroes removed their cloaks and placed them around the unfortunate prisoners to help warm them.\n\nThe air was cleaner outside, so the heroes led the survivors back up the stairway and away from the dungeon. But as they passed the bodies in the hall, the rescued captives screamed and wept.\n\n“Who has done this?” asked one of the heroes, but they were too distraught to answer.\n\nOutside the wind had died down and the rain had stopped. The heroes lit a fire in the courtyard of the old fort and the survivors gathered around it. At length, an older man named Thaurdir spoke, “We didn’t see what happened. We couldn’t. They kept us locked in that dungeon for days without any light. We could only hear the screams...” His voice trailed off.\n\nThe man’s hood covered most of his face so the heroes could not see his expression. After a moment he continued, “We could hear the harsh voices of the Orcs too, but there was another voice that commanded them. I don’t know what kind of creature it was, but it was terrifying to hear.”\n\n“We found none but Orcs when we arrived here,” spoke one of the heroes.\n\n“Then it must have escaped,” answered the old man.\n\n“If that is so, we cannot stay here,” replied the hero. They turned to their companions and said, “We should take these people to Fornost where the Rangers are gathered. Iârion will want to hear what they can tell him of their capture.” Turning to the former prisoners, he said, “You will be safe there.”\n\nThe rest of the heroes voiced their agreement, but the traumatized survivors merely nodded. After they had given their charges something to eat and water to drink, the heroes began their slow march to Fornost.",

        "flavorIntro": "It was a long journey from the Weather Hills to Fornost Erain, made longer by the weary survivors the heroes were escorting. The unfortunate villagers had suffered much hardship during their captivity, and the unusually cold weather did not improve their condition. Soon they were all sick from their ordeal. In the end, the heroes had to send a runner ahead to summon help from the Dúnedain they were seeking.\n\nWith help from the Rangers, the heroes were able to bring the survivors safely to Fornost. Once the capital of Arthedain, the ancient city was abandoned after the war with Angmar, almost a thousand years ago. Now the desolate ruin was called Deadmen’s Dike, yet on high days, the Dúnedain still gathered there, as they did now.\n\nIârion and a younger Ranger were there to greet them when they entered the city gates. The noble Dúnadan had a look of wonder on his face as he watched the heroes bring the survivors inside the walls. “You have exceeded your oath in saving these people,” he exclaimed. “On behalf of the Dúnedain, I thank you friends. Come, join us at the council fire and tell us your tale. My brother, Amarthiúl, will take care of your charges.”\n\nThe younger Ranger, a man of good stature, brought the survivors to see the healers while Iârion led the heroes to the central square of the city. A council of Dúnedain were gathered there around a large fire. In the place of honor was their Chieftain, Aragorn, son of Arathorn. He looked at the heroes with keen interest as Iârion introduced them, “Here is the valiant company that helped us defend the villages of Bree-land and pursued our enemies to their hiding place in the Weather Hills. They have come here with the survivors they rescued from the Orcs, and with evil news.”\n\nThe heroes described for the Rangers the details of their adventure: the burnt homesteads, the Orcs’ captives, the old border-fort of Amon Forn, and the grisly sacrifices. After the whole account had been made, there was a long silence before Aragorn finally spoke.\n\n“Your tale is full of woe,” said the son of Arathorn, “We have not heard of such evils since the fall of ancient Angmar.”\n\n“Indeed,” replied Iârion, “their tale bears the very trappings of Angmar. The king of that cursed land was a powerful sorcerer, and many stories such as theirs were heard in his day.”\n\n“Aye,” answered Aragorn, “but the armies of Angmar were defeated, and the Witch-king fled the North. That fell wraith now commands the fortress of Minas Morgul and threatens Gondor with war. These foul deeds cannot be his doing.”\n\n“And yet the crimes we hear of now are the same as were uncovered in this very city when it was recovered from Angmar many years ago,” insisted Iârion. “If they are not the Nazgûl’s work, then perhaps one of his disciples has returned to take his place?”\n\nAs the Dúnedain debated this question, the setting sun fell behind the hills of Evendim to the west, and the sky darkened above them. From another part of the city there came a shrill cry, and a moment later Amarthiúl came running towards the council.\n\n“Iârion! Iârion!” he shouted between breaths. “We are betrayed!”\n\n“What is it?” asked Iârion. “What has happened?”\n\n“Black sorcery!” said Amarthiúl, seizing Iârion’s arm. “One of the survivors. The old man. The one called Thaurdir. He...” The younger Ranger took a breath, “He is a wraith!”\n\n“A wraith? How did you learn this?” asked Iârion with an astonished voice.\n\n“When I brought the survivors to see the healers, I saw the old man slip away. I thought that suspicious, so I followed him in secret,” explained Amarthiúl, speaking quickly. “He walked straight to the tombs and there cast aside his cloak. His face was drawn and withered like a corpse, but his eyes!”\n\nThe young Ranger blanched, and then continued, “I made no sound, yet he looked straight at me where I hid among the shadows, and I knew he could see me with those hollow eyes. Being discovered, I drew my sword to confront him, but he merely laughed. It was the most horrible sound I’ve ever heard! Then, from the open tomb behind him, I could see the spirits of the dead gathering around him. That is when I ran here.”\n\nIârion was about to reply when the flames of the great fire suddenly burst into the air and then died, leaving the Rangers in total darkness. All about them, a chill fog gathered. From within the black mist they could hear scraping and rustling sounds. As their eyes adjusted to the dark, they descried the horrid outline of many ghouls in rusted armor surrounding them. The dead faces glared at them with hollow eyes, and rotted hands raised ancient blades to attack.\n\n“To arms, Dúnedain!” shouted Aragorn, drawing his blade. “The wraiths of Angmar are upon us!”",

        "doNotRead": "The Rangers were unprepared for an attack, and they were nearly overmastered by the sudden onslaught of Thaurdir and his ghouls. But the heroes who stood with them rallied the Dúnedain to victory with their unyielding courage.\n\nEven so, it was a frightful battle. Swords were not the enemy’s only weapon, and the fear of them nearly drove the heroes mad. Yet as the dawn drew closer, the sorcerer’s spells began to fade and the Rangers gained the upper hand. However, just as victory seemed assured, Thaurdir seized Iârion and fled the city. The brave Ranger was holding two enemies at bay when the sorcerer struck him over the head with a resounding blow. Then, Thaurdir ordered two of his minions to retreat with the body. From behind a press of ghastly warriors, the heroes saw Amarthiúl give chase but they were unable to aid him because of the enemies that barred their way.\n\nAs the first light of sun broke through the clouds, the heroes struck down the last of their unnatural foes and ran after Amarthiúl. They found him at Deadmen’s Gate; his eyes glazed in a stupor. He still wielded his sword and struck at the air around him, but there were no ghouls left to fight.\n\n“Amarthiúl!” cried one of the heroes, “The dawn has come, and the enemy has fled.”\n\nThe Dúnadan lowered his sword and regarded the heroes as one waking from a dream. “I couldn’t reach him,” he muttered as he fell to his knees. “When I saw them take Iârion, I tried to follow. But the fog grew thick around me, and I lost my way.”\n\n“It was an evil spell that clouded your eyes,” said one of the heroes, trying to comfort the young Ranger. “The wraith that attacked us was a powerful sorcerer. It was he that took your friend.”\n\n“Why?” asked Amarthiúl, but none could answer. On the ground, the young Ranger found the hawk pendant of Iârion and regarded it in his hand.\n\n“It matters not,” said the Dúnadan, clutching the pendant and rising to his feet. “Thaurdir has taken my friend, so I will pursue him.”\n\n“We will aid you in this quest,” spoke the heroes with one voice. “We cannot abandon Iârion to the same fate as those village people.”\n\n“Then let us depart swiftly,” said Amarthiúl, sheathing his weapon. “We may still rescue him if we move quickly!”",

        "flavorIntro": "The battle at Fornost was fierce and bitter, and left many of the Dúnedain wounded. The sight of the wraiths had very nearly broken their spirit, and had it not been for the valiant efforts of Iârion’s companions, the Rangers would not have withstood the attack. Once dawn had finally arrived, the Dúnedain recuperated their strength, shoring up the defenses of Deadmen’s Dike and tending to the wounded.\n\nAmarthiúl had other concerns. Iârion had been captured during the battle by the Wraith Thaurdir, and there was still time to come to his aid. The heroes who had helped defend Fornost vowed to rescue Iârion as well, and so their hunt began. It didn’t take long for them to find the enemy’s tracks leading northeast into the hills.\n\nThaurdir and the remnants of his forces, including the minions that subdued and captured Iârion, were making great haste across the North Downs. Despite the enemy’s efforts to get away, the heroes were smaller in number and eager to pursue their quarry. Iârion’s captors took little care to cover their tracks, and so the hunters spent many hours chasing afoot without stopping to rest, eat or find their bearings. They traveled far into the night, hoping to overtake Thaurdir under the cover of darkness. But when the sun rose over the green hills, they had still closed little ground on their adversary.\n\nAmarthiúl looked north to the horizon and sighed, worry etched upon his brow. “It’s no use. Thaurdir is a Wraith of the shadow world, and his minions care not for food or rest. They travel unhindered for weeks without feeling weariness, while we struggle to keep pace.” He turned to his companions, forlorn.\n\n“Patience, my friend,” one of the heroes said, clasping Amarthiúl’s shoulder. “Whether it be at sunset tonight or a fortnight from now, we will not stop pursuing them until we have rescued Iârion. They must have some need of him alive, for we have seen no sign that harm has befallen him.”\n\n“Indeed, although that thought worries me equally,” another of their company said. “Amarthiúl, what do you know of Iârion? What reason would Thaurdir have to take him captive? Surely Aragorn, Chieftain of the Dúnedain, would have been a greater prize.”\n\nThe young Ranger took Iârion’s pendant from one of the pouches he wore across his belt and stared at it remorsefully.\n\n“I... I am not sure,” he said, shaking his head. “Iârion comes from a noble bloodline, that I do know. This is the symbol of his house,” he explained, showing the heroes the pendant of the hawk-in-flight they’d seen Iârion wearing. “A lesser prize than Aragorn you say, and no doubt that is true. But Aragorn’s true heritage we have long kept hidden from the Enemy. Iârion’s heritage needed no such safekeeping. As long as I’ve known him, he has worn this pendant proudly.”\n\nThe Ranger’s eyes narrowed and he looked at the heroes with bitter vengeance deep in his thoughts. “Whatever the reason, I know what I saw at Fornost. Thaurdir could have taken many others, but left them dead or wounded instead. When Iârion challenged him, he sent his minions one at a time, sacrificing them to Iârion’s blade in order to wear him down. He meant to capture Iârion alive. Perhaps that was his goal all along.” The rest of the company nodded in response to Amarthiúl.\n\n“All the more reason why we must pace ourselves,” one of the heroes said. “We are no help to Iârion falling over with exhaustion. We must be ready to fight when we reach the Wraith. Let us press on!”\n\nThey continued to track their quarry for many miles, keeping a more sustainable pace, resting briefly when necessary and pressing onward with haste when the enemy’s tracks led them downhill or through level country. Eventually they reached the edge of the North Downs, where the green hills gave way to the vast and desolate lands of northern Eriador. The weather grew colder and fouler the further north they traveled. Snow and freezing rain began to pelt their cloaks and hoods, and for the first time since departing Fornost, they felt the need to camp for the night.\n\nThat was the first night they heard the howling. It came from all around them, growing louder with each passing minute. One of the heroes took charge and alerted the rest of the company. “We cannot tarry. The wolves here are evil and vicious, and the darkness of night is their hunting ground.”\n\nThey quickly broke camp, the weight of weariness beginning to take its toll. Throughout the night, the incessant baying of wolves was ever at their heels. Amarthiúl gave voice to their common concern: “I fear our hunt has just become theirs...”",
        "ruling": "**Daybreak and Nightfall**\n\nThis scenario includes a double-sided objective, Daybreak / Nightfall. The Daybreak side of this objective has the text “It is Day” and the Nightfall side of this objective has the text “It is Night.” The condition of “Day” or “Night” has no inherent effect. However, many encounter cards in this scenario (including Daybreak and Nightfall) have additional or different effects, depending on whether it is currently Day or Night.",
        "doNotRead": "They had endured the freezing cold and the biting fangs of evil wolves for many days, traveling as far as they could by day and fending off fierce attacks each night, but over time the company had grown weary. Defeating the pack’s leader had caused the creatures to retreat, but spending restless nights chased and harassed by wolves had forced them far off track, close to the peak of Mount Gram which towered into the northern clouds. They were far from Thaurdir and their friend Iârion, with no way to tell how much time had been lost fighting the evil wolves. Worse, they were far too exhausted to continue marching without sleep, and many of them had grown sick from the cold. What little game there was to hunt in the wastes had been scared off by the wolves, and the rations from Fornost were running out.\n\nAfter many days of these conditions, a night with no howling was a great relief. The company discussed at length whether this meant it was safe to camp for the night, but in the end, they were too hungry and weak to continue. Knowing they were in a dangerous position, they had no choice but to stop for the night.\n\nThat was when the Goblins struck. They emerged under the cover of darkness, clad in white fur that blended with the snow. The sentries that kept watch were taken from behind, pulled to the ground and gagged. One spotted the approaching Goblins and called out, but was immediately struck by Goblin-arrows. The sentry’s shouts woke the rest of the company, but taken by surprise and outnumbered nearly ten to one, the odds were grim. The largest of the Goblins stepped forward and grinned wickedly. “Surround them! Don’t let any escape!” it bellowed, “Gornákh wants them alive!”\n\nThe ensuing battle was futile. The heroes fought valiantly, but the heavy snow impeded their movement and the Goblins had a strong upper hand. Most of the company was knocked unconscious or cornered and surrounded. Others fought to the bitter end, though the Goblins seemed to be trying to take as many captives as possible. Those who resisted and could not be captured were pierced with stone arrowheads or spear-tips, and left to bleed in the snow.\n\nThe heroes were forced to submit, disarmed of their weapons, and bound. They looked amongst themselves for a moment before they realized that Amarthiúl was no longer standing among them. They weren’t sure if his body was among the slain.\n\n“Come along now, lads,” the larger Goblin growled, pulling one of the heroes to his feet and forcing him to march at spear-point. “Mount Gram awaits.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Blindfolded, the company was marched into the tunnels of Mount Gram. It seemed they walked for miles uphill, and through many winding corridors. When the blindfolds were removed, they were deep in the heart of the Goblin stronghold, with no knowledge of an escape route.\n\nGornákh’s dungeons were gruesome and awful. They smelled of rot and decay, and the floor was damp, covered in frost and slime. Flickering torchlight scarcely illuminated the dungeon’s halls. The Goblins separated the companions and brought them down different tunnels, passing by chambers filled with wicked instruments. Cries of lament and pain echoed throughout the dungeons, making their hearts sink with dread.\n\nThe companions were thrown into separate prison cells, all windowless and scaled with frost. Some were dragged to cells close to the dungeon’s entrance, and others were brought much further into the belly of the dungeons. Each was alone. Any attempt on their part to call out to their companions was met with a swift beating.\n\nOne by one, they were brought to the chamber of Gornákh, who interrogated them cruelly at the edge of a knife or whip, adding to their scars and their misery whenever they gave an unsatisfactory answer. Even so, none would dare betray their companions or their mission, and spoke nothing other than witty retorts or curses under their breath.\n\nOn rare occasions, they were offered a repulsive meat of unknown origin that smelled of death, and likely tasted just as bad, though none of them dared to eat it. After prolonged starvation, however, even this foul meat was starting to look tempting. Having lost track of time in the never-ending darkness of the dungeon, they started to wonder if there was any hope of escape. A seed of despair took root and began to grow.\n\nFinally, the monotony was broken when one of the company’s heroes overheard what sounded like a regiment of Orcs arriving in the dungeons. “Gornákh!” a familiar voice bellowed, his voice echoing throughout the halls. “We have come to claim your prisoners in the name of Daechanar!” The hero stood in their cell and leaned against the cold bars, trying to see past the darkness. There could be no mistaking that voice, warped and tinged with evil. It was Thaurdir, the Wraith they had confronted in Fornost. The one who had taken their friend.\n\n“But, we are the ones who captured them! They are our prizes, not yours... And I am not yet done playing with them!” Gornákh protested, angry with Thaurdir’s presence.\n\nThe voice of Thaurdir was cold and imposing. “Remember to whom you speak,” he responded. “Lord Daechanar has claimed these for his own. Bring them to Carn Dûm at once. They will make fine soldiers for the Lord of Angmar.” There was a long, sinister pause. “Or do I have to remind you what Lord Daechanar does to those who do not obey?”\n\nThe hero clenched their hand over the bars of their cell, surprised at the mention of a Lord of Angmar. The argument between Thaurdir and Gornákh grew heated. Several of Gornákh’s guards ran out of the hall, presumably heading to where the argument was taking place. The hero shuddered to think of what fate might befall the Goblin who defied Thaurdir—or worse, the fate that awaited the hero’s companions. Just then, a faint light crawled across the walls, and the lightest of footsteps approached the cell. The shape of a hooded man appeared, illuminated dimly by the light of a torch. The hero drew away from the bars cautiously.\n\n“Don’t fret,” the man whispered, and Amarthiúl pulled down the hood that covered his face. He raised a keyring and unlocked the door to the cell, and a wave of relief washed over the prisoner.\n\n“Amarthiúl! You came back for us!” the hero whispered, exiting the cell and embracing the Ranger.\n\n“Of course. After the battle with the Goblins, I escaped and managed to track everyone to this mountain. I couldn’t find a way in at first, but when Thaurdir and his Orcs arrived, I slipped in behind them. Once the jailor was distracted, I made my way to your cell. The way I came is now guarded by Orcs from the north. However, there is a another exit, a hidden gate high in the southern end of the mountain. I overheard one of the Goblins talking about it.”\n\n“Good,” the hero replied. “We’ll find as many of the others as we can and make our way to this southern gate.”\n\nAmarthiúl hesitated for a moment, and clenched his jaw. “If Thaurdir is here, that means that Iârion is here as well. He must mean to bring us all north to Carn Dûm, together.”\n\nHe handed his keyring to the hero, closing his companion’s hand around it. “There are many more of our company imprisoned here. Find them and make your way to the southern gate. I will try to find Iârion, and meet you there.” The hero nodded, and the two clasped forearms. With that, the Ranger quietly headed back the way he came.\n\nThe newfound sense of freedom gave way to anxious dread.\n\nThe halls were quieter than ever before. Alone and without weapons or gear, the task ahead was daunting. Even so, the rest of the company could not be abandoned. The hero steeled their resolve and went to work...",
        "ruling": "**The Captured Deck**\n\nWhen setting up Escape from Mount Gram, stage 1A instructs each player to prepare a separate captured deck. A captured deck represents the allies, heroes and equipment taken from each player’s party that they must find and recover before they can be played.\n\nTo prepare a captured deck, remove all allies, **Item** attachments, **Mount** attachments, and **Artifact** attachments from a player’s deck and shuffle them together. This pile is now referred to as that player’s captured deck. A captured deck does not have its own discard pile; any cards that are discarded from a captured deck are placed in its owner’s discard pile.\n\nAfter preparing their captured deck, each player chooses 1 hero to be their starting hero. Then, each player randomly sets aside 1 of their remaining heroes, facedown. Shuffle any remaining heroes into their owner’s captured decks; then place each facedown set aside hero on top of its owner’s captured deck.\n\n**Captured Cards & Rescuing Cards**\n\nWhen cards are captured facedown underneath an encounter card, those cards are called “captured cards,” and are considered to be out of play, under no player’s control. This can occur from the capture X keyword, or from encounter or campaign card effects that instruct a player to capture 1 or more cards underneath a specified card. If a card is captured from play, all tokens on that card and attachments on that card are discarded. When an encounter card or quest card with 1 or more captured cards underneath it leaves play, all of the captured cards underneath it are “rescued” by their owners. Rescued cards are placed in their owners’ hands. If a hero card is rescued, immediately put it into play under its owner’s control.\n\n**Creating a Staging Area**\n\nWhen each player is instructed to “create their own staging area,” each player sets aside an area across from their heroes to serve as their own private staging area. Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the first player (which continues to move), but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently in the game.\n\n ∙ Players cannot affect players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower another player’s threat, play an attachment on one of their characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\n\n ∙ During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 4 players have been separated, each player would add 1 card to their staging area.\n\n ∙ Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area. For example, if an effect references “each player,” then that effect only refers to each player that shares the staging area to which the encounter card would be added.\n\n**Joining Another Player**\n\nOn stage 2B players are instructed to “join another player” if there are no captured cards underneath it. Joining another player happens at the beginning of the travel phase. The joining player(s) must add any encounter cards in their own staging area to the staging area of the player(s) they are joining with, keeping any enemies engaged with them and discarding any active location in the staging area being left. If multiple players have no captured cards underneath stage 2B during the same phase, they join quests starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise around the table. If there is no player to join, then players must continue to stage 3.",
        "doNotRead": "In hindsight, the dank cold of the dungeon was tranquil in comparison to the icy weather outside. The narrow pass twisting down the snowy mountainside was slippery and treacherous, and one false step could spell doom. After cautiously making their way down the pass for hours, they reached the base of the mountain, hid in the treetops, and waited.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Amarthiúl descended down the narrow pass and the company was reunited at last. Iârion was not with him. “Thaurdir is aware of our escape,” the Ranger said grimly once they had said their greetings and taken stock of their numbers. “Our fortunes have turned. Now we are the ones being pursued.”\n\n“And what of Iârion?” another of their company asked, to which Amarthiúl’s response was solemn silence.\n\n“I tried to reach him,” he explained after a long pause. “He was held captive by the Orcs who came with Thaurdir. He was unconscious, but unharmed. I slew many of the Orcs, but that awful Wraith appeared and fought me back. He ordered that the Orcs take him to Carn Dûm, and held me at bay while they escaped.”\n\nAmarthiúl cursed and slammed his bloody fist against a nearby tree, furious and desperate. “I was beaten again. I barely made it out alive. And worse, Thaurdir is hot on our trail. I fear I’ve only made things worse.”\n\n“You rescued us from torture and death, or worse,” one of the heroes replied, comforting their friend. “For now we must regroup and get away from this awful place. I fear we cannot pursue Iârion’s captors north, not in our current state.”\n\n“Are we to abandon our mission, then? To abandon Iârion?” Amarthiúl asked. “No, we cannot. We must make haste towards Carn Dûm, to catch up with the Orcs and rescue him!”\n\n“I understand how you feel,” another one of the companions assured Amarthiúl, “but are we, alone and weary from our imprisonment, to confront all the forces of Angmar in their bastion of Carn Dûm?”\n\nAmarthiúl opened his mouth to respond, but he knew they were right. Most of them were wounded, and some hadn’t eaten in days. Their clothing was torn, their rations long gone, and they had little of the equipment they’d brought with them from Fornost. “You’re right,” he said at last, sorrowful. “What, then? Have we failed in our quest?”\n\n“No,” the hero said with a smile. “Not yet. Not while there is hope. We know they desire Iârion alive, for whatever ill purpose. We have no choice but to head south, to Rivendell, to seek the counsel of Elrond and gather our strength.” He clasped his hand on Amarthiúl’s shoulder. “Perhaps then we can assault Carn Dûm to rescue Iârion. But there are many miles between here and Rivendell, and Thaurdir still pursues us. One step at a time, brother.” Amarthiúl nodded, and the company set off to the south.",

        "flavorIntro": "The company had barely escaped from the dungeons of Mount Gram with their lives, thanks to the bravery of the Ranger Amarthiúl and the skill and guile of the heroes who rescued their companions. Heading south from Mount Gram, they found the return to Rivendell fraught with peril at every turn. The need for haste forced the company to travel into the wild lands of the Ettenmoors, a decision they quickly regretted.\n\nThe Ettenmoors were an untamed and dreary land, overrun with Trolls and beasts that roamed the wilds, constantly searching for food. The heroes had recovered some of their belongings in the dungeons, but were exhausted from their imprisonment and in bad shape to be fighting such monsters.\n\nThe rolling hills were beset with horrid weather. The skies did not clear for even a moment, a torrent of rain constantly pelting their cloaks. The rain muddied the ground, soaked their clothes and chilled their bones. The clouds overhead were obsidian. At night, they blotted out the moon and the stars, and the occasional flash of lightning was the only light to guide them. Now and again, a roar of thunder crashed around them, setting their ears to ring.\n\nThere was little food to be found in the hills of the Troll-fells, and even less shelter. If they could find a haven - a small cave to hide in, or a patch of trees to give them cover - they could take a brief rest, safe from the Trolls and the rain. However, they would soon be forced to move again, for they would have to keep a steady pace to make it to Rivendell in time to help Iârion. At least, that was the reason they gave for their haste. They knew the Wraith Thaurdir was pursuing them still, and the thought of him catching up to them in this dreadful place brought terror to their hearts...",
        "ruling": "**Objective-Locations**\n\nDuring this scenario, there are four objective-location cards: Patch of Woods, Secluded Cave, Abandoned Camp, and The Hoarwell. These cards are objectives that are also considered to be locations for all purposes, except they do not have [threat], and have the guarded keyword, like other objectives.\n\nWhile an objective-location is guarded by another encounter card (including a side quest), it cannot be the active location. Like other guarded objectives, after the attached encounter leaves play, the objective-location returns to the staging area. Only then may the players travel to it. (If an objective-location is guarded by a location, the players are not considered to be traveling to the objective-location if they travel to the location guarding it.)",
        "doNotRead": "The journey through the Ettenmoors was full of hardship and turmoil, but the company was able to persevere through the wilds. They had endured the cold and evaded Trolls—and worse—at every turn. When they scaled the last hill and saw the woods of Rhudaur before them, they breathed sighs of relief and rejoiced for the first time since escaping the Goblin dungeons.\n\n“This is the land of Rhudaur, one of the three kingdoms of old Arnor,” Amarthiúl explained as they entered the pine woods. “The line of Isildur did not survive in Rhudaur, and over time the number of Dúnedain here dwindled. The elders tell us that evil men, hillmen in league with the realm of Angmar, usurped the last king of Rhudaur many hundreds of years ago. From that moment on Rhudaur was a vassal of the Witch-king, and those Dúnedain still remaining in this land were either slain in cold blood, or fled west.”\n\n“You are well-schooled in the history of your people,” one of the heroes said in amazement.\n\nAmarthiúl smiled. “It is important that we Dúnedain remember who we are and where we come from,” he replied. “Our kingdom was divided and our people were scattered in the long war with Angmar, and not many of us remain. But we believe there will come a time when the blood of Isildur can reunite the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. If we forget our heritage, we lose our purpose.”\n\nOnce they felt that they had traveled far enough from the Troll-fells that they could safely rest, the company set up camp, hunted game and cooked a fresh meal for the first time in weeks. But they could not linger for long. Their destination was still many miles to the southeast, and they felt a cold chill following them into Rhudaur, as though tendrils of dread had crawled after them through the moorland...",

        "flavorIntro": "Having escaped imprisonment in the Goblin dungeons of Mount Gram and an icy death in the rugged Coldfells at the hands of hungry Trolls, the heroes had finally reached the woods of Rhudaur. The company made good time for several days, fair weather and plentiful food motivating them to travel at a brisk pace. Yet, no matter how many leagues they crossed, the dark presence and fear that had been tugging at the back of their minds ever since escaping Mount Gram never ceased to haunt them. When they slept, they were plagued by dreadful nightmares, and every waking moment was filled with the sensation of being pursued.\n\nAs they traveled, evidence of the kingdom’s collapse peppered the woods. They crossed through ancient ruins and made their way around towers of stone and rubble, long forgotten and ravaged by years of disrepair. “This area has been largely uninhabited for centuries,” Amarthiúl explained to them. “Once Rhudaur was annexed by the Witch-king, those loyal to him were called to fight in his long war with Arthedain. The kingdom of Rhudaur was abolished and left to ruin.”\n\n“They should have you teaching young pupils,” one of the companions said with a chuckle, and Amarthiúl himself gave a smirk.\n\n“Perhaps, but this is the path I chose for myself,” Amarthiúl disclosed. His expression grew solemn. “When I was younger, I followed Iârion and several other Rangers on a hunting expedition. I was eager to prove myself to the others, that I could be one of them. But I was too brash and foolish, and the orcs captured me. Iârion risked his life to save me. His determination, his willingness to sacrifice everything, inspired me to become more than a scholar or a healer. I swore that I would repay my life debt with steel and blood. I wanted to become a warrior and a leader like him, to save others like he saved me.”\n\nThe Ranger gave a sigh and rubbed his forehead, worried. “Now he is the one held captive, tortured or worse, and I am powerless to help.”\n\nAmarthiúl appeared inconsolable. It had been tough watching the young Ranger’s determination go unrewarded for so long. “I understand now why you are so driven to find him,” one of the heroes said. “Do not lose hope. We are not defeated yet.”\n\nJust then, the young Ranger’s gaze was drawn behind the heroes, deeper into the woods, and his eyes widened. “Is that what I think it is?” he muttered, and ran ahead. They hadn’t seen Amarthiúl run that swiftly since departing from Fornost. It didn’t take long to catch up to the Ranger - the building he had seen lay fifty meters away, obscured by trees and brush. The pinewood forest opened into a small clearing, concealed on all sides by dense overgrowth. At the other end of the clearing, they saw a stone gatehouse, decrepit from years of disrepair, forgotten by time, but standing strong nevertheless. Behind the gatehouse stood the ruins of an ancient keep tucked into the woods. They had seen several such ruins throughout their journey, but what caught their eyes was the symbol painted upon the wooden door of the gate. It was the symbol of the regal hawk-in-flight. Amarthiúl pulled Iârion’s pendant from underneath his tunic, where he wore it on a thin chain.\n\n“This symbol... It’s the same!” he exclaimed, holding the pendant up next to the symbol on the door.\n\n“You said Iârion wore this pendant proudly as a symbol of his lineage,” one of the heroes said, and the company exchanged anxious glances. “This is a fortuitous discovery. We have not the slightest clue why Thaurdir - and this Daechanar who commands him - took Iârion captive at Fornost. If Amarthiúl is right and the Wraith was after Iârion in particular, these ruins might hold the answer to this mystery.”\n\nThere was a murmur of agreement, and Amarthiúl nodded. “Then what are we waiting for?” he declared, an eager light in his eyes. But as soon as they opened the door to the gatehouse, a furious gale, chill as ice, knocked them to the ground. The wind shrieked. There was a foulness in the air all around them - in the ruins, and in the woods behind them. Something evil haunted Iârion’s ancestral home, and worse, the malevolence that had followed them from Mount Gram was close behind...",
        "ruling": "**The Investigation**\n\nThis scenario includes 3 side quests which are added to the staging area during setup with the quest side faceup. These cards are double-sided, with a side quest on one side and a **Clue** objective on the other side. While they are quest side faceup, they function as an encounter side quest. Each of these quests has the text, “**When this quest is defeated, flip it over**.” This means it should be turned so that it is objective side faceup. As an objective, each of these cards has text that allows the players to claim the objective and attach it to Amarthiúl, or to a hero. Therefore, by completing each of these side quests, the players are able to claim objectives that aid them in their quest.",
        "doNotRead": "The company’s investigation of the ruins was fruitful, but dangerous. Iârion’s ancestral keep was haunted by the wights of Dúnedain who had sided with Angmar, and the spirits of those they had slain in their wicked pact. It seemed that few Dúnedain had managed to escape from this place alive, just as the heroes were barely able to escape with their lives.\n\nOnce they had reached a reasonable distance, they began to piece together what they had found inside the keep as they walked at a brisk pace. Most of the ancient documents they found were too tattered and faded to read, but some were still legible. Among them was a family tree, inscribed inside a leather tome bearing the hawk crest they had become familiar with - the crest of Iârion’s family.\n\n“Look!” the hero holding the tome shouted, pointing to the tree. “I recognize this name: Daechanar. That is the same name as the one who commands Thaurdir – the ‘lord of Angmar’ mentioned in the Goblin dungeons!”\n\nOne of the companions shook her head, pondering what they had learned. “It cannot be the same person. It’s been many centuries. The Dúnedain are long-lived, but they are not immortal. The Daechanar in this family tree should be long dead by now...”\n\nThey pondered that thought for some time, but they were too weary from their hardships to come to any conclusions. While they were starting to understand the events that had unfolded in Arnor many hundreds of years ago, there were too many pieces of the puzzle still missing.\n\n“We should continue to Rivendell,” one of the heroes declared at last. “Even Thaurdir cannot pursue us there, and we can consult Elrond about these matters. If there is anyone who will understand what we are dealing with, it is he.”\n\nThere was a murmur of agreement, and the company continued traveling with great haste. The ghostly presence of Thaurdir hung over them still, an ominous stormcloud threatening to overtake them if they dwelled any longer...",

They were greeted by Elven guards who recognized the heroes and welcomed them, escorting the company into The Last Homely House and offering them food and drink, which they accepted heartily. When they asked to see Elrond, they were granted a swift audience and brought into Elrond’s Hall.\n\nThe Elf-lord entered soon after, bidding the heroes to sit and tell their tale. The company spoke at length with Elrond about their long journey - their discovery at Amon Forn, the attack on Fornost, their imprisonment in Mount Gram, and the information they found in the ruins of Rhudaur.\n\nWhen they mentioned the name Daechanar and showed Elrond the tome they had found in the home of Iârion’s ancestors, his eyes narrowed with recognition and his jaw clenched. “That is a name I have not heard spoken in over a thousand years,” he said. “The Daechanar you speak of was once a Dúnedain of Rhudaur. It is he who paved the way for the kingdom’s collapse, defecting to the side of Angmar and joining the Witch-king as one of his trusted lieutenants. His brother Iârchon and his sons were among the few Dúnedain who managed to escape, fleeing here to Imladris to dwell for a time.”\n\nElrond knew of what he spoke by memory. He had lived through these events, and not read of them in a book. “Not long after, the forces of Angmar laid siege to Rivendell. We were beset by our enemies for some time, but after many seasons we broke the siege. Iârchon was among those who fought to defend Imladris. I watched as he met his traitorous brother on the fields of battle. Daechanar was slain and the battle was won, but Iârchon was disturbed by his brother’s last words and came to me seeking counsel. I still remember those words, to this day: ‘I will outlive all of you and haunt your descendants long after you are dead. My master has seen to that.’ I feared that the lord of the Nazgûl had taught some manner of foul sorcery to his lieutenant, that which knits dead flesh and traps spirits long-deceased within this realm.”\n\nAmarthiúl’s eyes went wide with fear and realization, and he rose to his feet. “Do you mean to tell us that the Daechanar who commands the dead we have encountered is this same Daechanar, who died so long ago?”\n\n“Just so,” Elrond replied, and bid the young Ranger to sit once more. “Only I believe he was never truly defeated - his body was broken, but his spirit remained. ‘I will haunt your descendants long after you are dead.’ You say that Iârion was captured alive at Fornost, and I do not believe this to be coincidence.” He paused for a long moment, considering what he had heard.\n\n“Iârion is of Daechanar’s blood. I believe he means to possess Iârion, to use as his new body. Then, his return to this world will be complete. With the Witch-king in Minas Morgul, Daechanar would rule over the dark land of Angmar - you’ve already seen orcs at his command and the Goblins of Mount Gram in his allegiance. The safety of the north would be shattered.” It seemed difficult to believe, but the wisdom of Elrond did not lie, and the heroes did not doubt for a moment the truth behind his words. Finally, everything they had experienced made sense.\n\n“Iârion has been captive for weeks,” one of the heroes said mournfully, hoping all was not lost. “Are we too late to stop Daechanar’s plan from coming to fruition?”\n\nAmarthiúl clenched the pendant of the hawk-in-flight which hung from his neck, and spoke passionately. “We must head north immediately!”\n\nElrond spoke calmly despite the dire situation, raising his palm to the Ranger. “Your bravery is admirable, young Ranger, but have patience. A powerful ritual such as this is not something easily cobbled together. It is no coincidence that Thaurdir and his forces attacked when they did. In several weeks, midwinter will be upon us. It is the coldest and darkest day of the year’s cycle, the last day before life begins to spring anew. On midwinter’s night, Daechanar will find his passage into Iârion’s body easiest. If I am correct, he is biding his time and waiting for the right moment. That means we have time to gather our strength, and for you to rest. You must be weary from your long journey.”\n\nThe Elf-lord then called several Elves into the hall, and tasked them with traveling south and west to find as many Rangers as they could and summon them to Imladris. “I do not have a host of Elves to send into battle, but those I can spare will accompany you north, to the fortress of Carn Dûm.”\n\nThe heroes looked at one another and nodded, confirming their intentions and rising to their feet. One of them gave Elrond a short bow and addressed him politely. “Daechanar must be stopped. We shall venture north as well, and see this mission to its end.”\n\nAmarthiúl turned to the heroes, his expression full of stern determination. “My friends, time and time again you have put your life on the line for my kin. Please, allow me to join you. Wherever your travels lead you, my swords shall be yours if you give me leave to assist.”\n\n“You have earned your place among us,” one of the heroes said, clasping Amarthiúl’s forearm. “We are grateful to have you fighting by our side.”\n\nFor over a fortnight the company rested well in Rivendell, recovering from their wounds and exhaustion. Each day more Rangers responded to Elrond’s call, arriving in Imladris with bow and sword, eager to seek vengeance for their brethren who fell in Fornost. They waited as long as they could to prepare for the assault, but they were soon out of time and could tarry no longer if they wished to reach Carn Dûm before the winter solstice. With a small but determined band of Elves and Rangers at their side, their only hope was to fight their way into the fortress so they could stop Daechanar’s ritual...",

Once the heroes had defeated the Orcs guarding the entrance and made their way inside, all was eerily quiet in comparison to the battle raging outside. The halls of Carn Dûm were cold and lonesome, though no matter where the heroes ventured within its walls, the feeling that they were being watched never ceased. The realm of Angmar had claimed immeasurable lives over many hundreds of years in its long war with the Dúnedain. With each step they took, their burden grew worse.\n\nThe fortress was sprawling, but if they strained their senses, they heard cries of pain coming from below. So, deeper into the stronghold they ventured, down many long and steep flights of stairs, the corridors becoming narrower, the stone walls pressing in all around them.\n\nSomewhere within these catacombs, surrounded by the watchful dead, their friend Iârion was struggling in torment.

        "doNotRead": "The heroes had but seconds to spare as the catacombs crumbled and collapsed around them. They ran as fast as they could, trying to remember the route they took through Carn Dûm’s dark and labyrinthine halls. The walls shook and screeched as a dark power coursed through them. Walking corpses collapsed and decayed, foul spirits dispersed, and the power that Daechanar had summoned began to crumble with his defeat.\n\nThe dark clouds above the fortress scattered, and the light of day washed over the battlefield. With the defeat of their master and the sun glaring down at them, the Goblins fled south to their mountain refuge. The remaining Elves and Rangers, rallied by the turning tide, drove the Orcs into a full rout. The battle was won... but the victory was bittersweet. As the heroes emerged from the fortress carrying Iârion’s body, their company was filled with a great sorrow. Though they were able to defeat Daechanar and stop his plans from coming to fruition, they were too late to save their friend. The tragedy of slaying the Ranger with their own hand was something the heroes would never forget, although they had his final words to comfort them.\n\nThe return trip was melancholy, but swift. Although winter had come to the north in full force, the deadly, unnatural weather they had become familiar with seemed to subside with the fall of Daechanar, and the evils of Angmar no longer dared to emerge and stand in the heroes’ way. Once they had put the peak of Mount Gram behind them, the Elves decided to part ways, heading back to Rivendell. The heroes thanked them for their aid, and in return the Elves told them they were welcome to return to Imladris once their business with the Dúnedain was finished. The rest of the company continued west to Fornost, to lay to rest their fallen comrades.\n\nThe Rangers and the heroes buried the dead in a tomb dedicated to those who fell in defense of the North, and gathered together to speak words in memory of their valiant sacrifice. After everyone but the heroes and Amarthiúl had left, the young Ranger approached Iârion’s sepulcher, holding the pendant of the hawk-in-flight. “I was not able to save him,” he said as the heroes approached. The death of Amarthiúl’s mentor weighed heavily upon his heart.\n\n“None of us were,” one of the heroes replied, mournfully. “But had you not been determined to pursue Thaurdir and rescue your friend, who knows what horrors Daechanar would have unleashed upon the lands your kin protect?”\n\nThe Ranger nodded, clutching the pendant tighter. “He had no siblings or heirs. The line of Iârchon and Daechanar is ended.” With that, Amarthiúl stepped forward to place Iârion’s pendant atop his tomb. Letting go of Iârion’s pendant seemed to be a difficult act. As he lay the pendant on the tomb of his friend, he calmly sang:\n\nA fearless man in darkest night\nA faithful brother bright with mirth;\nHis spirit now is taken flight\nBeyond the circles of the earth.\n\nOne of the heroes rested a hand on Amarthiúl’s shoulder. The Ranger had come a long way and had grown much during their journey. “Iârion was a noble warrior. He would be proud to see how strong you’ve become.”\n\nThey lingered for some time, grieving their loss, before they finally emerged from the quiet tombs of Fornost. “What will you do now?”\n\n“I pledged my swords to you, remember?” Amarthiúl said with a warm smile. “The Dúnedain are in your debt. I aim to repay that debt. If you ever need my assistance, do not hesitate to call upon me.” With those words of friendship, they parted ways. The heroes traveled back to Rivendell and spent the rest of winter under the care of the Elves, recovering from their many journeys and battles. Before the snows thawed, however, a messenger came for them bearing a scroll with a peculiar seal.\n\nIt seems the heroes were needed once again. Fully rested and ready for adventure, they thanked Elrond for his hospitality and ventured back into the wild, riding as fast as they could to the west... toward the Grey Havens.",

        "flavorIntro": "The road west to the Grey Havens was as peaceful and uneventful as the company of adventurers could have hoped. The horrors they faced in the dread realm were far behind them, and with spring blooming, they were free to enjoy their travels for the first time in what seemed like ages. It wasn’t long before they passed the Tower Hills, and arrived at the gates of the Havens.\n\nThey were greeted warmly by Círdan the Shipwright, the Master of the Grey Havens, leading a group of Elves. “Thank you for all responding to my letter so quickly. Allow me to welcome you to Mithlond, the last port of the Elves east of the great sea of Belegaer,” he said to the heroes with a smile. The wisdom of ages past shone in Círdan’s eyes. “Follow me, and I shall bring you to our meeting chambers. There, you shall discover the reason why you have traveled many leagues from Rivendell.”\n\nEager to assist in whatever manner they could, the company followed the Elves through the gates and were escorted to a tall white tower overlooking the Gulf of Lune. Elegant Elven ships were docked in the harbors, tall and white with the star of Eärendil shining upon their sails. They were as much works of art as they were sailing vessels, beautiful examples of the exceptional craftsmanship of the Elves. Strangely, there were also two Gondorian vessels docked in the port, the White Tree of Gondor emblazoned upon their sails.\n\nThe tower’s circular meeting chamber was beautifully decorated. Open arched windows facing the west allowed for a steady breeze of sea-wind that kept the company cool as they waited. Soon after their arrival, a wiry middle-aged man entered the room. He had long black hair, a thinning beard, and high cheekbones. “This is Lord Calphon of Dol Amroth,” Círdan introduced the man, “and he has come a long way by sea to seek our assistance.” Lord Calphon stood and smiled, shaking their hands one by one. His eyes were equal parts relief and worry.\n\n“It would be easier if I started at the beginning,” Calphon explained as he sat down at the table, worriedly fidgeting with his clasped hands. Círdan made a gesture to the nobleman as if to give him the floor, and Calphon told his tale. “It started but a few months ago: I had a peculiar dream, the most vivid dream I’ve ever had. In this dream, I saw a beautiful island in the wide ocean, and I longed with all my heart to go there. I saw ruins of ancient Númenor that sprawled across the island, reaching even deeper below the waves. The moment I awoke, I knew that it was not a simple dream. But that was not the only dream I had.\n\n“I continued to dream of the island and its secrets for months. To this very day, I have visions of its temples and ruins. I did not believe the island could exist, because we in Gondor are taught that Númenor sank beneath the ocean in its entirety. I’d heard of the wisdom and foresight of the Elf-lord Círdan, and thought that if any should know of the great ocean of Belegaer, it would be the Elves who sail its seas. So I took my ship, the *Dawn Star*, the formidable *Duskbringer*, and the fastest ship from the fleet of Dol Amroth, the *Silver Wing*, and ventured here in the hope Círdan could lend his wisdom.” He nodded to Círdan, who turned to address the heroes.\n\n“I have been assisting Calphon in interpreting his dreams, and have come to the conclusion that the island in his visions is but a sunken peak of Númenor. That land indeed drowned beneath the waves when the Valar unleashed their wrath upon the Númenoreans. But I believe its highest peaks may have survived its Downfall. It cannot be coincidence that Calphon, one of Númenorean blood, dreams of his ancient homeland.”\n\nThe heroes listened to Calphon’s story and the wisdom of Círdan with great interest. Once Círdan had finished speaking, one of the heroes stood and politely asked, “Even knowing of the island’s origin, finding it in the open ocean would be quite an undertaking. Of what assistance can we be on this venture?”\n\nCírdan walked to the chamber’s open windows and looked out to the Gulf of Lune and the harbor of Mithlond. “This will be a long journey, and while I cannot see what dangers Calphon should face, I sense that great peril follows in his wake. I have not the power to command you, but should you desire to assist, I would ask that you sail with him and help him reach the island from his visions. I sense the utmost importance in this quest.”\n\nThe heroes looked among themselves for a time, but there was no argument or debate. The urgency in Círdan’s voice and his fabled foresight were all the heroes needed. They nodded to one another in agreement. “We shall accompany Lord Calphon on his voyage,” one of the heroes stepped forward and spoke. “But, we have not a vessel of our own.”\n\nCírdan smiled and his eyes shone bright, as though he knew the heroes would accept. He bid the heroes follow him, and exited the chambers with eager steps, the company following close behind. They accompanied the Shipwright down many flights and through white archways, until they came at last to the docks of the Havens. Sunlight danced on the water’s surface, and seagulls sang over the Lune. “Behold!” said Círdan, motioning to the nearest dock.\n\nA beautiful Elven ship lay anchored in port. It was white, with folded wings on its sides, and on its prow was carved a majestic swan. “I envisioned this vessel long before Calphon reached out to us,” the Elf-lord said, placing his hand upon the side of the ship with care. “It was built for a voyage of paramount importance, but has never yet left the Gulf of Lune. I believe this is the journey for which it was built. From here on, this ship shall be known as *Oloroitarë*, the ‘*Dream-chaser*.’ I give this ship and its crew to you, the champions of Gandalf and Elrond, to keep you safe in your journey. There are two other vessels docked in this port, the *Glórinaith* and the *Nárelenya*, which you may also find useful, should you need them. These ships, and those of Lord Calphon, shall be your fleet.”\n\nThe *Dream-chaser*’s strength and beauty were second to none. The heroes thanked Círdan with all their hearts, humbled by the greatness of the Shipwright’s gifts. “We shall not fail in our quest,” spoke one of the heroes, bowing low. “Nor shall we fail to keep safe the gifts of the Havens.”\n\n“I do not doubt it,” Círdan replied, smiling. And with that, preparations were made for their long voyage...",

The Corsairs had pursued them across many leagues of ocean. To see the horizon with no signs of the enemy was a great relief to the heroes, and to the crew.\n\n“I don’t understand,” Calphon said quietly. “Gondor is a hated enemy of the Corsairs of Umbar, ‘tis true. But why would these Corsairs pursue us for so long, and so far?”\n\n“I’m more concerned with the fact that they were so far north to begin with,” the hero chimed in. “We were only several days out from the Havens when we first spotted them. It can’t be a coincidence. They must have followed your ships from Dol Amroth.”\n\nCalphon’s eyes widened, and he was stricken with concern. “What? But, I hadn’t seen any signs of them in my voyage north...” He gripped the ropes of the ship tightly, his knuckles turning white. “... It pains me greatly to think that my actions may have put the Elves of the Havens in danger. I hope that Círdan will forgive me.”\n\nThe hero comforted Calphon with a smile. “Don’t worry. All this confirms is that our journey is not in vain. The Corsairs must have pursued us this far for a reason. Our aim should be to discover that reason. Let us find the island from your dream, and see for ourselves what secrets it holds.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The sky was bathed in a beautiful sunrise, the bright orange sun rising over the peak of the mountain just as Calphon had described. “Land ho!” a sailor shouted, and the fleet buzzed with activity. The island was large, dominated in its center by the peak of what must have once been a tall mountain. Deep in the island’s dense jungle were broken towers and ancient ruins.\n\n“So, it does exist,” Calphon whispered as he reached the bow of the ship, looking out to the island with great relief. “I’m glad I did not lead us to the middle of the Belegaer for naught.” The heroes shared Calphon’s relief, but had always suspected the island was real, as the wise Círdan would otherwise not have sent them on such a dangerous voyage. The ships were anchored off the western coast of the island, and the crews lowered small canoes onto the surface of the ocean. The company prepared to disembark and make their way to the shore, arming themselves in case the island proved dangerous, and making sure to take enough rations for several days.\n\n“You should stay here,” one of the heroes told Calphon as they prepared to leave. “You’ve done your part in helping us find the island. Now is the time for us to do ours.” Calphon shook his head and refused, determined.\n\n“No, I must go with you,” he explained. “I may not be able to lead us once we are on the island, but I’ve spent the better part of a year envisioning this day. I need to set foot upon that shore and see the ruins of Númenor for myself.”\n\nThe heroes looked amongst themselves with worry, but none could bring themselves to refuse Calphon’s request. “We know not what secrets or dangers the island may hold,” one of them said. “But if this be your will, we shall honor it and protect you.” Calphon nodded without deliberation.\n\nThe company boarded the smaller vessels and set forth, rowing in the direction of the uncharted shore.",
        "ruling": "**Preparing the Uncharted Deck**\n\nWhen Uncharted locations are included in a scenario’s encounter deck, that scenario’s setup may instruct the players to “prepare the Uncharted deck.” This is done by shuffling all of the double-sided locations with the Uncharted keyword into a separate pile. This pile is referred to as the Uncharted deck. When preparing the Uncharted deck, each card in that deck should be Lost Island side faceup, so that players do not know which location is on the facedown side.",
        "doNotRead": "Exploring the uncharted island was exhausting, but it was the onslaught of the faithless undead that made the company’s travels truly perilous. Making their way deeper and deeper into the island, they’d finally come to a building of note – an imposing shrine, tucked into the side of the mountain.\n\nAs soon as they crossed the threshold of the shrine, they felt the presence of something dark and evil. Tapestries and statues, faded and ruined from years of disrepair, depicted the evil Morgoth as a great and powerful being. “We in Gondor know the tale of Númenor’s glory and downfall; that in the dark days before Númenor’s destruction, many faithless Númenoreans worshipped Morgoth,” Lord Calphon explained, examining one of the foreboding statues. “This must have been one of the temples erected in his worship.”\n\nThey searched the shrine extensively, but ultimately it proved fruitless. With many questions unanswered, the company began to lose hope that the shrine was their true destination. Wishing to continue their exploration of the island, they began to leave, but Calphon insisted they stay. “Wait! We mustn’t go yet... I... I remember this place, I think...” He ran his hand along the far wall, as if attempting to remember the secrets the stones themselves held. “I remember... The sound of a hammer upon the anvil... The heat of the forge...”\n\nThe company looked amongst one another with concern, approaching Calphon cautiously. The nobleman’s eyes were closed as he placed his ear upon the wall, listening closely. “Lord Calphon?” one of the heroes said after a moment, placing a reassuring hand on Calphon’s shoulder. The nobleman startled as though waking from a dream, and he turned towards the heroes with a shocked expression. “There’s something here!” he exclaimed. He walked several paces to another section of the wall and placed his hand on the stones.\n\nTo the company’s surprise, the stones gave way, and the wall opened outwards as if upon invisible hinges, a door leading into a hidden passageway. Wide-eyed and wordless, Calphon entered the passage, the heroes close behind. The corridor was narrow and dank. They soon found themselves descending a flight of steep stairs, deeper into the darkness of the temple. Finally, after many steps, they came to a small chamber with a raised altar in its center. Two candelabras stood on either side of the altar, ancient and unlit. On the altar lay a large key of black iron.\n\n“A key?” Calphon said, taking the key in his hands, a puzzled expression upon his face. “I don’t understand. I sought the answer to this mystery, but all we have found on this island is another riddle.”\n\n“Perhaps the Elves of the Havens will have the answer,” one of the heroes suggested. With no sign of a matching lock anywhere on the island, the company made their way west, to the coast.",

        "flavorIntro": "The voyage back to the Grey Havens was long, but not nearly as perilous as the adventure to find the island from Calphon’s dream. Despite the fleet’s distance from familiar stars, without Corsairs hounding their every move, it was a relatively simple matter to head northeast until they reached the coast of Middle-earth, following it north to the Gulf of Lune. The heroes were constantly on the lookout for black sails, but none were seen along their journey. Finally, they reached the safety of the Grey Havens, and were welcomed by the ringing of bells and elves singing over the gulf.\n\nOn the evening of their arrival, they were brought to the meeting hall once more, and they celebrated, for their quest had been accomplished. The Elves bid them tell of their journey, and the company obliged, although Calphon remained silent for much of the tale.\n\nCírdan took great interest in the company’s story, as they told of their voyage to find the island, and of their exploration of the ancient ruins of Númenor. “I’m not sure how I knew where to look,” Calphon said of his discovery in the shrine to Morgoth. “T’was as if... as if I was remembering something from my past, from a long time ago.” He reached into his doublet and pulled out the mysterious black key, which he’d placed on a thin chain around his neck, and set it onto the large table in the center of the council. “This strange key is all we found on the island. We thought that perhaps the wise Elves of the Havens would know what significance it holds.”\n\nThe Elves examined the key closely for some time, and Círdan stroked his beard in contemplation. Finally, Galdor, one of the wisest in Círdan’s council, broke the silence. “It is surely Númenorean in design, and yet there is something odd about it. I know not what lock it might open.” Calphon sighed, feeling hopeless. Galdor handed the key to Círdan, and as soon as he took it in his hands, a shudder coursed through his body.\n\n“There is an unwholesome quality to this key,” he said, turning the black key over in his hands and staring at it as though attempting to look through it. Before he could examine it further, they heard a commotion on the watch towers. “The sea-watchers!” Galdor shouted. The heroes rushed to the tall windows overlooking the gulf. To their dismay, they could see Corsair ships advancing from the west, their black sails difficult to see under the cover of night. Arrows red with fire began to fill the sky, and skiffs rushed toward the docks.\n\nThe chamber erupted into chaos. “Corsairs! Corsair raiders are upon us!” Elves and Men shouted outside the tower, and the sounds of battle boomed like a storm around them. The smell of burning wood wafted in from outside. Círdan ordered Calphon and the other Elves to make their way to safety before turning to the heroes and asking for assistance. “They’re burning the ships in the harbor!” he exclaimed, distraught. “We must prevent them from destroying the fleet!” Nodding in agreement, the heroes drew their blades and ran to join the fray.",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "The battle was hard fought, and several ships were lost in the flames. But with the heroes’ assistance, the Elves were able to turn the tide of the battle and repel the Corsairs. The Corsair leader, a hardened captain named Sahír, ordered a full retreat, and their ships fled quickly west out of the Lune.\n\nThe Elves put out the remaining fires and took stock of what had been lost in the raid. “Corsairs have never been seen this far north. What purpose did attacking the harbor serve?” one of the heroes asked aloud. “They had not the numbers to take the Havens.” There was a murmur of agreement at first, until one by one they realized their folly. The heroes thought about their voyage to the island, and how the Corsairs had seemed to know of their plans, pursuing them far into the Belegaer.\n\n“Lord Calphon!” a voice among them shouted, and they ran back into the tall tower overlooking the gulf, weapons still drawn. With haste they flew up many flights of steps, until finally they reached the quarters of Lord Calphon, bursting through the door.\n\nThey were too late. The nobleman lay slain on the floor of his chambers, a pained expression upon his face. He had a deep wound in his chest, as though skewered by a sword. Several of Calphon’s bodyguards, along with a few Corsairs, were also killed in the struggle. The mysterious black key, and the thin chain upon which it hung, was missing. A three-pronged hook was latched to the base of one of the open windows, and a long rope trailed down to the sea below.\n\n“We have no time to lose,” one of the heroes spoke after a moment of shock and mourning. “The Corsairs have taken the key. That is why they retreated: they’d already accomplished their goal.” The heroes gave their final regards to the nobleman from Dol Amroth, and went with haste to the *Dream-chaser*. There, Círdan was assessing the damage done to his greatest work, and to the other ships in the Elven fleet. When they gave him the news of Calphon’s murder, he shook his head with dismay.\n\n“You must pursue them, as fast as the wind can take you. I give to you the helm of the *Dream-chaser* once more. I’m sure Calphon’s crew would give leave to let you captain his ships, in his stead.” His eyes shone bright as the stars above. “The road ahead will be uneasy, and I know not where it ends. But that key is at the heart of things, that much is certain. Find it, and discover its purpose!” The heroes nodded and departed at once, in search of the artifact, and in revenge for Calphon.\n\n—————\n\nNa’asiyah slid her knives back into her bandolier, disgruntled. They’d accomplished their goal, but Sahír had completely ignored her plan. She and a small team of her best raiders had taken a rowboat and snuck up to the Elven towers under the cover of the evening mist. With their skill in stealth, they should have been able to infiltrate the tower, subdue the Gondorian, and grab the artifact without notice. Instead, the moment they had reached the tower, they heard bells and sounds of battle.\n\nWith all of Mithlond alerted to their presence, Na’asiyah’s job had became much more difficult. The nobleman’s bodyguards were well-trained, and several of Na’asiyah’s raiders had been lost in the fray. In the end, they had been forced to slay the Gondorian in order to get the key. She’d hoped to capture the nobleman; to make it look like he had simply vanished, so they could have made a clean getaway. But thanks to Sahír’s attack, that option had been impossible.\n\nAs soon as the *Stormcaller* and its fleet were out of sight of the Havens, she stormed into the Captain’s quarters, arms folded across her chest. “With all due respect Captain, what happened out there? Attacking the Havens was our plan of last resort. I thought we were going to sneak in and retrieve the artifact, not start a damned war.”\n\nCaptain Sahír was sitting in his chair, legs raised and crossed on his table. He looked exceedingly pleased with himself, smiling as he turned the black key over and over in his hand. “Na’asiyah,” he said casually, “We are Corsairs. We do not sneak about as thieves in the night. The sea is ours. Those who would share it must tremble to see our sails on the horizon.”\n\n“Captain, did you not choose me to be your first mate? If you were going to ignore my advice, the least you could have done was warn me. Now we have stirred the hornet’s nest. We could have vanished in the night, and been leagues from the Havens before they even knew the key was gone. Now they will surely pursue us with all the speed they can muster.”\n\nSahír’s smile diminished, and his eyes met Na’asiyah’s with a sinister glare. “My dear Na’asiyah, are you afraid of them?”\n\n“Of course not, Captain,” she said calmly, her eyes narrow. She’d questioned the wisdom of Sahír’s plan, but she had no qualms about spilling blood, if it be her Captain’s will. “I just hope that your prize was worth the lives of the sailors we lost.” She left with a curt nod, closing the door to Sahír’s quarters behind him. The sailors on the deck looked to her for orders, as they often did when Sahír was preoccupied. Sea-wind coursed through her thick hair, and she felt a moment’s reprieve from strife and anger. “Well? What are you waiting for, you lousy lot?” she shouted to the crew, hotly. “We’ve got ships to outrun! Full sail ahead!”",

        "flavorIntro": "The *Dream-chaser* and her fleet departed at once from the Grey Havens, sailing swiftly on a fortuitous wind. Calphon’s men toiled with renewed vigor, filled with fire and vengeance over the death of their lord. Their foe had a considerable lead, but the heroes swore that the Corsairs would not escape justice.\n\nBy the time the rising sun was visible on the horizon, the *Dream-chaser* and her fleet had left the Gulf of Lune and turned south. The Blue Mountains loomed over the coast to the east. “Given the speed of our pursuit, we will surely be upon them soon,” one of the heroes surmised. “Our target is the ship we saw at the Grey Havens – that is where their captain retreated after the battle.”\n\n“But they will not be sailing alone,” said another. The sailors and soldiers in the company nodded in understanding, ready for battle.\n\n—————\n\n“Enemy ship sighted!” The shout came from a raider high atop the *Stormcaller*’s main mast. The entire crew was now echoing the alarm, taking their positions and preparing for battle.\n\nNa’asiyah made her way to the quarterdeck, pushing through the sailors in her way. “Don’t just stand there, you fools!” she shouted to the crew as they parted for her. “I want three of you on each oar and eyes to the north! Signal the rest of the fleet! Make sure they are ready for battle!” The crew snapped-to and raised their voices in a rhythmic shanty as they pulled the oars.\n\nThe captain was at the helm, wearing his usual smile, sea-wind flowing through his dark hair. If he had heard the crew’s shouts of alarm, he did not look worried. Na’asiyah took the narrow steps two at a time, running to the ship’s edge. The raised deck gave her a perfect view of the northern horizon. Sure enough, a white ship was in swift pursuit, its sails bulging with wind at its back. Her dark eyes narrowed.\n\n“Already they are on our tail,” she said with disdain, quiet enough to mask her concern from the crew, but loud enough for the captain to hear.\n\n“They are fierce sailors, I’ll give them that,” Sahír noted. “But they are no Corsairs. Their corpses will litter the sea-bottom before the end.”\n\nNa’asiyah strode to the helm and leaned against the railing, her arms crossed over her chest. She had lived most of her life under Captain Sahír’s command, and she could not remember him this bloodthirsty. Not that he had ever been gentle or soft-spoken, but his brutality had always been... purposeful. Deliberate.\n\nShe gave her captain a piercing gaze, and they locked eyes. “When are you going to tell me what the key opens?” she asked, for what seemed like the hundredth time since they sailed from Umbar.\n\n“When you are ready,” he barked. It was the only reply he ever gave her. She took a dagger from her bandolier and ran a finger along its edge, deep in thought. Sahír had taken their fleet far to the north, farther than they had sailed in her entire life. He’d told the crew that they were to follow a Gondorian ship sailing out of Dol Amroth, a ship he somehow knew would be heading north along the western coast, and still she had no idea where he’d learned this information. It wasn’t until they saw the Gondorian ships with their own eyes that Na’asiyah and the rest of the crew believed the captain was telling the truth.\n\nPerhaps Sahír was right. Perhaps she wasn’t ready. Despite following his orders for years, she’d doubted him. “Do not toy with me, captain,” she said, sheathing her dagger. “I understand you have a plan. I simply want to know what we’re getting into.”\n\nSahír laughed heartily. “War, my dear.” He grinned. “We’re getting into war.”",
        "ruling": "**Preparing the Stormcaller Area**\n\nThe setup for this scenario instructs the players to “Prepare the Stormcaller’s area.” To prepare the Stormcaller’s area, the players must prepare a second quest deck consisting of stage 2C, stage 3C, and stage 4C, in that order. (The quest stages labeled stage 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A are used in the player’s quest deck, as normal.) Then, in an area next to the Stormcaller’s quest deck, place the Stormcaller enemy card.\n\n**The Stormcaller’s Area**\n\nThe Stormcaller’s area is a new play area, separate from the staging area, that represents the Stormcaller’s journey in its attempt to flee from the players. As the players advance through their quest deck, the Stormcaller also advances through its quest deck, attempting to reach and defeat stage 4 before the players do. The quest stage on top of the Stormcaller’s quest deck is called “the Stormcaller’s current quest stage.” Each of these quest stages has the following text: “**Forced**: At the end of the round, discard the top card of the encounter deck. The Stormcaller places progress on this stage equal to its [threat] plus the [threat] of the discarded card.” Every round, this effect causes the Stormcaller to make progress on its stage, just as the players try to make progress on their quest stage.\n\nIf the Stormcaller’s current quest stage has progress on it equal to or above its quest points, it advances to the next quest stage in the same way players would, first advancing to the “C” side of the next stage, resolving its effects, and then advancing to the “D” side.\n\nWhile the Stormcaller is at a different quest stage than the players, cards in the Stormcaller’s area are immune to player card effects, cannot leave the Stormcaller’s area, and are not considered to be in the staging area (and thus do not contribute their [threat] to the total [threat] in the staging area). Players are considered to be at “the same stage” as the Stormcaller if their main quest stage’s name and number match the Stormcaller’s current quest stage (“2B–Full Sail Ahead!” and “2D– Full Sail Ahead!”, for example).\n\n**When the players and the Stormcaller are at the same quest stage, cards in the Stormcaller’s area are no longer immune to player card effects, can leave the Stormcaller’s area, and are considered to be in the staging area** (and thus **do** contribute their [threat] to the total [threat] in the staging area). Thus, by catching up to the same quest stage as the Stormcaller, the players can travel to locations in the Stormcaller’s area and engage ships in the Stormcaller’s area, including the Stormcaller itself.",
        "doNotRead": "The chase was longer than either party had anticipated. Although the heroes had quickly gained on the *Stormcaller*, before the voyage was over, the weather had changed for the worse. Harsh winds and rough waves slowed their progress, and other Corsair ships harassed them at every opportunity, blocking their passage and forcing them into battle. With every setback, the *Dream-chaser* prevailed, much to the dismay of the *Stormcaller*’s crew, who cursed the heroes each time their white sails appeared on the horizon.\n\nAfter many days, traveling as fast as the wind could take them, the heroes finally caught up to the Corsairs, sailing around the Cape of Andrast at the southern edge of the western coast. A terrible storm wracked the seas and threatened to sink both fleets. Flashes of lightning splintered across the sky, and waves as tall as hilltops crashed into the bow of every ship that dared to round the cape. When the skies finally settled, the mast of the *Dream-chaser* had begun to splinter, and its sails were torn. Luckily for the heroes, the *Stormcaller* was also damaged. Both ships remained sea-worthy, but neither would be outrunning the other for some time.\n\n“Get ready to board the Corsairs!” one of the heroes shouted from the bow of the ship. Those who were in fighting shape lifted their swords high in the sky and began to sing, their voices echoing across the cliffs facing the water.",

        "flavorIntro": "With the squall still raging all around them and the *Dream-chaser* and her fleet damaged from their long pursuit, boarding the *Stormcaller* was a risky maneuver, and grappling with the ship would be even more difficult. The heroes decided that their best course of action would be to take control of the *Stormcaller*, subduing its crew while their other ships remained a safe distance away. Command of the *Dream-chaser* was given to Calaerion, an Elven sailor who had journeyed with them from the Grey Havens. Beneath the ship, the sea rumbled, though most of the crew scarcely noticed, and those that did paid no heed, their attentions turned towards the *Stormcaller* and its crew.\n\n“Remember, we need the key they stole from Lord Calphon,” one of the heroes announced. “We need to know the key’s purpose. If anyone knows, it’ll be their captain. So we must take him alive, if possible.” United, the crew took positions on the *Dream-chaser*’s starboard side, grabbing ropes to swing across. Their ship drifted into position as the Raiders on the *Stormcaller* prepared for battle. Blades rose over the Belegaer, and shouts rang out: “For Lord Calphon! For the Grey Havens!”",
        "ruling": "**The Stormcaller & The Thing in the Depths**\n\nThis scenario includes two separate encounter sets: The *Stormcaller* encounter set and The Thing in the Depths encounter set. The setup instructions for this scenario instructs the players to “Build the encounter deck using only The *Stormcaller* and Corsair Raiders encounter sets, setting The Thing in the Depths and The *Stormcaller* Elite encounter sets aside, out of play.” When setting up this scenario, players should set the entire The Thing in the Depths encounter set aside for the time being, shuffling together only the Corsair Raiders and The *Stormcaller* encounter sets. When the players advance to stage 2, the “When Revealed” effect of that stage will remove the Corsair Raider encounter set from the game and shuffle The Thing in the Depths encounter set into the encounter deck, completely changing the nature of the scenario!",
        "doNotRead": "The battle against the Raiders had been swift and fierce, but it was the terrifying attack of a monster under the waves that truly set the heroes on edge. Forced to join forces with the Corsairs they had sworn to put to justice, it took all of their combined skill and strength to save the *Stormcaller* from sinking.\n\nFinally, the monster succumbed to their blades, a number of its many arms dismembered. Slowly it sank back into the depths of the ocean, never to be seen again.\n\nTurning their attention to each other once more, the Corsairs and the heroes parted slowly, realizing their truce was at an end. “Lay down your arms,” one of the heroes commanded, weary from battle but still willing to fight. “Give command of this ship to us and we will spare your lives.” Several of the Corsairs who were still in fighting shape spat on the deck of the ship, swearing that they would never surrender. Both sides had suffered losses, and the *Stormcaller* seemed barely sea-worthy, but the Corsairs were prepared to continue the battle.\n\nBut, to the surprise of all, the captain threw his cutlass onto the deck and bowed.\n\n“I fear that we have started off on the wrong foot!” he said with a charming grin. “Please, allow me to introduce myself.” The heroes looked at one another, confused, but allowed the captain to speak. “I am called Sahír, and I am captain of this vessel you intrude upon. This is my first mate, Na’asiyah,” he continued, motioning towards the woman at his side. She had a dusky complexion, with long black hair in twisting, matted locks. A pattern in ink covered her arms and cheeks.\n\n“Captain, what are you doing?” she asked quietly, her dark eyes narrow, still holding her knives at the ready. She’d anticipated the captain to command his crew to fight to the death. The last thing she expected was for Sahír to parlay with the enemy.\n\nSahír gave her a toothy grin in return. “Aren’t you always advising me to use caution when outnumbered? Put those toothpicks of yours down and let’s have a friendly conversation.” Confused, Na’asiyah nonetheless followed her captain’s orders, dropping her knives to the ground. The other members of the crew followed suit.\n\nThe captain turned his attention back to the heroes, gesturing to his crew. “There, you see? We have laid down our arms. Time to fulfill your end of the bargain.”\n\nThe heroes looked at one another, concerned. “I don’t trust him one bit,” one of the heroes said at once. “Neither do I,” another responded, “but he’s surrendered and unarmed. We are honor-bound to take the crew alive and unharmed.” The other heroes nodded in agreement. They began to take the Corsairs into custody, binding their wrists and arms with rope. Many of the Corsairs struggled and cursed at the heroes, but none were willing to disobey their captain’s order.\n\nThe *Dream-chaser* circled back and the two ships were grappled together by rope, and wooden planks were lowered to allow the prisoners to cross onto the Elven ship. The *Stormcaller* was too heavily damaged to sail on its own, but with enough hands on oars, the two ships together could set forth. The Corsairs were brought intoa makeshift brig beneath the deck of the *Dream-chaser*, and much to their surprise, were treated with respect. They were given fresh fruit and clean water to eat and drink, and their wounds were tended with care. Na’asiyah and the other Corsairs were amazed by the care their hated enemies showed them. No Corsair crew would ever show such mercy, and Na’asiyah expected no better from Gondorians and their allies.\n\nIt quickly became clear that they had to find land soon, in order to repair the *Dream-chaser*’s mast, which made dreadful splintering noises each time the wind picked up, and looked ready to snap at any moment. They debated heading north to the coast, but weren’t sure if they could make it in time. Sahír, who overheard their conversation, was eager to assist. “There’s another way,” he offered. Na’asiyah raised an eyebrow, unsure of the captain’s plan. “An island I know of, to the east. Not far from here in fact. Plenty of trees for lumber, and food enough for both of our crews. What say you?” He grinned.\n\n“And why should you help us?” one of the heroes asked, uncertain of Sahír’s intentions.\n\n“Do you not remember the monster that tore apart my ship?” Sahír spat. “I have a stake in this, too.”\n\nThe heroes debated for a short time. They felt that they couldn’t trust the Corsair at his word, but their options were limited. If there indeed was an island nearby, they could gather supplies and use the time to interrogate Sahír about the artifact he had stolen from Calphon. “Fine,” they decided. “Give us the proper heading and we will follow it. Then, we’re going to have a discussion about what happened at the Havens.”\n\n“Of course,” Sahír replied with a sly grin. “I am looking forward to it.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes weren’t sure what to expect after following the heading given to them by Captain Sahír. But sure enough, just before high noon the next day, an island emerged from a curtain of rain on the horizon. With the exception of the western beach facing the fleet, the island’s coast consisted of steep cliffs and sharp jetties. Dotting the landscape were overgrown ruins peeking out from the cover of the trees, and atop the highest plateau, a grand temple.\n\n“This looks familiar,” one of the heroes said under his breath, and the others agreed – it was all too similar to the island from Calphon’s dream; the island where this all began. “Let’s anchor the ships off the shore, and then we’ll get answers.” They sent a few sailors in skiffs to scout ahead, search the shore for any danger, and set up camp. Then, the heroes went below deck to speak with their prisoners.\n\nThe Corsairs were still bound below in a small hold. Some were grateful for the provisions and bandages given to them; others remained spiteful and looked at their captors with hateful eyes. In the back of the hold, sitting with their arms bound, was Captain Sahír and his first mate, Na’asiyah. “I take it from the commotion above deck that you’ve found the island,” Sahír said as the heroes entered the chamber. “Believe me now?”\n\n“We’ll believe you when we know the full story,” one of the heroes responded, holding up the black key. They’d taken custody of the artifact after searching Sahír. “You followed us all the way to an island in the middle of the ocean. An island where we found this.” The hero holding up the key followed the captain’s eyes as he gazed at the artifact. “What does it open?”\n\nCaptain Sahír shrugged his arms and smirked. “Was the ancient lore and deep wisdom of the Elves not enough to figure it out?” The heroes shifted uncomfortably, angry at the captain’s mockery of Círdan and the Elves, but unable to refute his claim. “Alas, I was only sent to recover the key and the chest it opened. I know nothing of its contents,” he responded. Na’asiyah turned her head and glowered at her captain.\n\n“So you came all this way, pursued us over the wide ocean, and spilled this much blood... And you don’t even know why?” One of the heroes said angrily, his knuckles white.\n\n“If I had asked politely to hand over the key,” the captain mocked, “would you have obliged?”\n\nThe heroes ignored Sahír’s sarcasm and continued with the issue at hand. “This new island you’ve led us to – it is much like the island where we found this key. It bears temples and ruins from an age past. What was your true purpose in bringing us here?”\n\n“Alright, alright,” Sahír appeased the hero. “You win. Come, bring me up on deck, and I’ll tell you what I know.” The heroes brought both Sahír and Na’asiyah upstairs to the edge of the ship. “See that big temple?” Sahír asked, unable to point but motioning with his head towards the large temple to the east. “Somewhere inside lies the chest the black key opens.”\n\nThe heroes—as well as Na’asiyah—were stunned. “You’re sure?” one of the heroes asked. “He’s lied before. He could have been lying this whole time, for all we know,” another hero added.\n\n“Aye, and I could have led you into a maelstrom, or a fleet of my best Raiders. But I led you here, instead,” Sahír responded. “All I ask is that you bring me and my first mate along with you when you search the island.”\n\n“And why should we do that?”\n\nThe captain smirked. “Because I’m the only one who knows where the chest is inside that temple, and I’m assuming you don’t feel like scouring every inch of the place while fending off the cursed dead. So, if you’ll excuse me,” he said, walking back towards the hatch leading below deck, “I’ll be catching up on some well-deserved rest while you make camp.”\n\nThe heroes watched carefully as he was led below deck by one of the other sailors. After a few moments, Na’asiyah broke the silence. “I feel obliged to thank you for saving our ship.” She paused and took a deep breath before continuing, as though the words were difficult to say. “You could have destroyed the *Stormcaller* and thrown us into the depths of the sea if you wanted. But you didn’t.” She locked eyes with one of the heroes, her brows furrowed with doubt. “Why?”\n\n“That is not our way,” one of the heroes responded, and the others nodded in agreement.\n\nNa’asiyah lowered her gaze in thought, and her fierce exterior diminished for just a moment. Doubt and remorse were etched in her expression. Finally, after seeming locked in thought, she nodded to the heroes in understanding, and turned to follow her captain below deck.\n\nThe heroes discussed their options, but in the end they had little choice. If the island was anything like the one from Calphon’s dream, it would be crawling with ancient dead, and Sahír’s knowledge of the chest’s location was too valuable to leave behind. When it came time to explore the island, they cut both Sahír and Na’asiyah’s bonds, and gave them back their weapons. After all, two more warriors as skilled as they would surely come in handy. Grinning, Sahír led the way into the jungle...",
        "ruling": "**Preparing the Island Map**\n\nThe setup for this scenario instructs the players to “Prepare the Island Map.” This is done by separating all 15 of the double-sided Uncharted locations in the encounter deck and laying them out in a three by five grid as shown below, with each “Lost Island” card in the first four columns, and the three “Temple of the Deceived” cards in the rightmost column (see page 18 for an example). This should be done without looking at the facedown side of any of these locations, so that the map is randomly generated.\n\nAny card effects that reference a direction (left, right, above or below) should be interpreted from the perspective of the diagram below (“to the right,” for example, would mean in the direction towards the three Temple of the Deceived locations).",
        "doNotRead": "The island was covered in dense jungle, and it was difficult for the heroes to find their way. The ancient overgrown ruins were as dangerous as the jungle itself, inhabited by cursed undead who attacked the intruders with an unnatural malice. Finally they had defeated the guardian who held the gate key to the eastern temple, and made their way across the island at last to the temple’s vast halls.\n\nThough it was decayed from an age of corrosion and disrepair, the temple was grand and ornate. The adventurers could tell that, at one time, it must have been a beautiful–and terrible–place. Golden candelabras lined the halls, the doors were bejeweled with finely-cut gemstones, and the tapestries that hung from the walls were once bright and colorful. Now, the temple’s chambers were drenched in water, and the deeper they delved, the more crumbled and flooded it became. After traveling through the temple for some time, they reached a chamber with an opening in the wall, a crevasse that served as the entrance to a wide cavern. The walls were no longer worked stone like the rest of the temple, but dripping cavern walls, overgrown with vines, with mushrooms growing at their feet. Not a hundred feet further, they reached a wide precipice overlooking what appeared to be a pool of water. A pillar of light shining from the broken ceiling refracted off the surface of the water and illuminated the chamber in a brilliant blue hue. “Ah, here we are,” Sahír said, taking off his leather coat and his boots, one at a time.\n\n“What exactly are you doing?” one of the heroes asked, confused.\n\n“Oh, did I not tell you?” The captain gave a mischievous smirk. “We’ll have to go swimming, deep underwater, to get to the chest. Well? What are you waiting for? Not going for a swim in all that armor, I hope,” he chuckled, and without warning, leaped into the pool of the grotto.\n\nThe heroes sighed and began to disrobe, as well. “I wonder what else he’s neglected to tell us...”",

        "flavorIntro": "The water of the grotto was dark, and flecked with ice. With much of their armor removed, the adventurers felt vulnerable and naked in its chilling grasp. The first thing they had done was tie a line of cord to a stalagmite near the entrance, so they would not lose their way navigating the depths of the grotto, but the cord’s length would surely run out before they reached the secret chamber Sahír spoke of.\n\nSahír motioned for the group to follow, and they swam to the opposite side of the chamber. With a deep breath, Sahír dove underwater, and the party quickly followed suit, making sure not to lose sight of him should he try to lose them. He led them down a long tunnel near the floor of the cavern. As the tunnel stretched on, their throats began to tighten and their lungs begged for air. Strange plant life and stranger fish inhabited the caves, sea kelp pulling at their limbs as they swam. At last, they saw the water’s surface as the tunnel turned upwards, and they emerged from the water, shaking from the cold, and coughing for air. Sahír looked about for a few seconds before marching off, threatening to leave the heroes behind if they didn’t keep up.\n\n“Is he always like this?” One of the heroes asked Na’asiyah, who had lingered behind, not knowing the way as Sahír did.\n\n“The captain believes in inner strength, not help from others,” she explained, coldly. “If one is too weak to survive alone, help is not deserved.”\n\nThe heroes walked beside her, with Sahír leading the way ahead. “That must be a hard and lonely way to live, unable to seek assistance from others,” one of the heroes said. Individually, the heroes were strong and capable of great feats, but many times they had relied on the leadership of great captains, the wisdom of the Elves and the Istari, and the skilled hands of healers. Without this aid, they might have perished long ago.\n\nNa’asiyah looked at her feet for a moment, her jaw clenched. When she spoke, her voice was harder. “It is the only way I have ever known. To fight. To sail. To be free.”\n\nOne of the heroes shook her head. “I am sorry, but you will never truly be free, not while the Corsairs live under the thumb of Mordor.” Na’asiyah glowered back, eyes narrow.\n\n“We do not do the bidding of Mordor,” she said sharply. “We fight the Gondorians because they are our enemy. They want nothing more than to stamp us out like a nest of ants.”\n\n“That is the will of Mordor, not Gondor,” the hero responded adamantly. “It is the servants of Sauron who breed war, death and hate.”\n\nNa’asiyah considered the hero’s words, trying to understand. Her whole life, she had been told that the Gondorians and their allies were cruel and terrible, that their only love was in war, and that the Corsairs must be strong if they wished to remain free. But in just a short time, she’d experienced something very different. Those she’d met were skilled in war, but did not relish battle. They enjoyed each other’s company, and fought to protect those they cared for. They mourned the loss of Lord Calphon, and yet they spared the Corsairs’ lives and even saved them from certain death.\n\nA few minutes later, the tunnel opened up into a larger cavern. Sahír stopped in his tracks, looking about. “What’s wrong, lose your way?” one of the heroes called ahead.\n\n“Ah, shut your trap,” the captain snapped back. “It’s not as if I’m going from memory here.” Before the heroes could protest, a low-pitched wail echoed throughout the chamber, and the sounds of splashing and scraping surrounded them.\n\n“We’re not alone,” one of the heroes said quietly. They drew their weapons and forged on.",
        "ruling": "**Grotto / Underwater Locations**\n\nThis scenario includes nine double-sided locations that do not have the Uncharted keyword. Instead, one side has the **Grotto** trait, while the other side has the **Underwater** trait. During setup, the players are instructed to “prepare the Grotto deck”. First, the players must remove the double-sided “Shrine to Morgoth” card and set it aside (this card is put into play during stage 2). Then, turn the remainder of the double-sided locations so that their Grotto side is faceup, and shuffle them together into a separate pile. This pile is referred to as “the Grotto deck.”\n\nPlayers may freely look at the **Grotto** side of the top location of the Grotto deck. However, players cannot look at the facedown **Underwater** sides of any location until they are instructed to flip that location. **Flipping a double-sided location from one side to another removes all progress from it**.\n\nDuring the game, locations will often be placed from the top of the Grotto deck into the staging area. This must be done with the location entering play with its **Grotto** side faceup, without looking at its **Underwater** side (unless instructed otherwise).\n\nBecause these locations are double-sided, they cannot enter the encounter deck or discard pile for any reason. When one of these locations is explored, if it is **Grotto** side faceup, it is shuffled back into the Grotto deck, **Grotto** side faceup. If it is **Underwater** side faceup when it is explored, it has the victory keyword and is therefore placed in the victory display.\n\nNote that Grotto locations do not always have the same Underwater location on their facedown side.",
        "doNotRead": "The escape from the grotto was a blur. Angry, lost, and set upon on all sides by the cursed undead, it was a wonder they were able to make it out at all. They struggled to find their way, running and swimming as fast as they could to try and catch up to Sahír, but he was too far ahead. Worse yet, the captain had removed the cord they had used to mark their passage, and they were lost in the grotto for some time. By luck or fate, they finally found the entrance. Without discussion, they took a moment to rest, kneeling and leaning against one another to catch their breath and dry in the sunlight outside the grand temple.\n\n“I knew we should not have trusted him!” one of the heroes gasped, repeating what was on all of their minds.\n\n“What are we going to do?” Another asked, looking towards Na’asiyah. “... And what about her?”\n\n“What about me?” Na’asiyah snapped at the hero, angrily. “Need I remind you that he left me to die back there?”\n\nThere was a long pause before Na’asiyah spoke again, softer this time. “I knew there was something wrong about this voyage right from the beginning. Sahír knew about the Gondorian nobleman, but did not tell us how. He said we were to follow him, but did not tell us why. He knew what the key was for, but he did not tell me what it opened.” She took a deep breath, and added, “And he told you that he was ‘sent’ to retrieve it, but I have never known the captain to serve anyone but himself.”\n\nThe heroes considered her words carefully. “Na’asiyah, I don’t know what your captain is plotting, but please, help us stop him. Círdan warned us about that key. Whatever is in that chest must be of great value, to go to these lengths to retrieve it.”\n\nNa’asiyah nodded, although she remained unsure. “I’ll help you get to Sahír. I owe you that, at least. And besides, I have some questions to ask him myself.” She rose to her feet and started walking back towards the western coast, and the heroes followed.\n\nWhen they broke the treeline, they saw that the *Stormcaller* was gone, and their camp on the beach was destroyed. The bodies of several sailors who were cutting down trees for wood to repair the mast lay dead on the ground. All but one of the canoes they had brought to the shore had cracks punched through their hull, and the last was missing entirely.\n\n“He really did us in,” one of the heroes said after they’d examined the camp. “But at least our fleet is still afloat. And look there!” the hero exclaimed, waving out to the west. A skiff was rowing towards them, led by Calaerion, the Elf they’d put in command of the *Dream-chaser*.\n\nAs they rowed back to the *Dream-chaser*, the Elves reported what had happened. “We saw him taking one of the canoes from the shore and heading this way, but before we could apprehend him, several of the Corsairs we’d taken prisoner broke their bonds and attacked us,” he explained. “Fortunately, none of our crew were slain in the struggle, but they managed to escape on the *Stormcaller*. We didn’t want to leave you behind, so we stayed in the hope that you would arrive. We were about to send a search party when we spotted you on the coast.”\n\n“Sahír must have sent one of his birds back to the ship once he reached the jungle,” Na’asiyah explained. “I’ve seen him do it before, when we were stranded on an island off the coast of Harad. He always has a trick up his sleeve.” She looked to the eastern horizon as the sun began to set. “The *Stormcaller* can’t be far, as damaged as it was. But there is a Raider fleet gathered nearby – we’d planned on meeting up with them once we’d recovered the artifact. He’ll have signaled them by now. Even if your ships were in top condition, you wouldn’t be able to take them. You’re going to need help.”\n\nThe heroes agreed with Na’asiyah’s advice, and took command of the fleet. “Alright then,” one of them ordered resolutely, “We’ll repair the ships as fast as we can... and then, we head to Dol Amroth.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes were beyond relieved when they finally entered the inlet of Cobas Haven. Tall lighthouse towers guided their path through the bay as the dawn sun painted the sky with shades of orange and pink. The castle of Dol Amroth loomed over the coast to their starboard side, on a high promontory that overlooked the bay. It was a beacon of hope to all who looked upon it. Even Na’asiyah seemed in awe of its strength and beauty, struck in silence for much of the voyage.\n\nThe bay was filled with Gondorian ships – some simple fishing vessels, others built for war. Horns and bells sounded in the towers around them as the *Dream-chaser* docked. The sailors immediately set to work, continuing the repairs on their fleet, which became a much simpler task when docked in friendly waters. The heroes asked to speak with Prince Imrahil, and they were brought into the castle at once. The prince was eager to hear their tale.\n\nThe heroes entered the grand hall of Dol Amroth, a large chamber with many open windows and a balcony that overlooked Cobas Haven. The walls were decorated with banners depicting a silver ship with a swan-prow on a blue sea. Servants brought them fresh food and water, and tended to their wounds while they rested. Na’asiyah half expected to be treated with disdain or contempt, but—to her surprise—the moment the heroes told the knights that she was an ally of theirs, she was given the same respect and courtesy as any other in the heroes’ company.\n\nPrince Imrahil came to the heroes as soon as he was given word of their arrival in the castle. Although he greeted them with joy, he grew concerned when he did not count Lord Calphon among them. “Where is Lord Calphon? I was given word that he had met with you and Círdan at the Grey Havens, but no message has come since. When I was told of your arrival, I expected he would be with you.”\n\n“Alas,” one of the heroes said mournfully, “Lord Calphon is not among us. He was slain during an attack on the Havens.” Na’asiyah could see the pain and mourning in Imrahil’s face, and she felt naive and ashamed to have contributed to the battle at the Havens. Clenching her fist, she met Imrahil’s gaze with her own.\n\n“Tell me everything,” Imrahil said. “Spare no detail.” The heroes obliged, and together they explained to the prince everything that had led to their arrival in Dol Amroth – their discovery of the black key, the attack on the Grey Havens, their pursuit of the *Stormcaller*, and their exploration of the undersea grotto. Imrahil listened carefully, especially to Na’asiyah’s story, for it was one of the first times he had ever spoken to a Corsair as an ally. Both Imrahil and the heroes were surprised to hear that Na’asiyah’s original plan did not involve the killing of Lord Calphon.\n\n“So you believe that Sahír has summoned the Corsair fleet?” Imrahil asked at last, and Na’asiyah nodded with certainty.\n\n“Sahír is a cunning pirate, but whatever is in that chest has him obsessed. He will seek to protect his prize through whatever means necessary.” Na’asiyah now understood the kind of person her former captain truly was. “He never really did care for any of us. It pains me that I never noticed. He stoked our anger with lies, told us of crimes against our people that were never committed, tricked us into thinking we fought for our freedom,” she explained, her words sharpened with anger. “In truth, we only ever fought for him, to solidify his dominion over Umbar.”\n\nPrince Imrahil nodded, placing a hand on Na’asiyah’s shoulder. “He has not won yet,” he said. “We will muster our fleet and head south at once. If it is a battle Sahír wants...” Imrahil began, but his sentence was interrupted by the sound of horns over the bay. Shouts erupted from outside: “Corsairs! Corsairs from the south!” The heroes ran to the balcony and saw an approaching host of black ships.\n\n“He’s sent his fleet to intercept us while he escapes to Umbar,” Na’asiyah said. “It’s what I would have done. Ironic that the first time he would heed my advice would be after I have left his service.”\n\nImrahil commanded his captains to prepare for battle before turning once more to the heroes. “Aid me in defending my city, and I will make sure your ships have a clear path to catch Sahír.”\n\nOne of the heroes clasped arms with Imrahil, concurring. “We would have defended Dol Amroth either way.”\n\n“I’m coming with you,” Na’asiyah declared, her expression purposeful. “I believe the Corsairs are in need of a change of leadership.”",
        "ruling": "",

Many Gondorian ships were destroyed in the battle, rammed by cruisers with iron serpent-prows, set aflame by fiery arrows, or crushed by heavy stones thrown by trebuchets.\n\nIn the end, however, Dol Amroth stood triumphant, as it had many times before. The *Dream-chaser* and her fleet broke through the Corsairs’ blockade, heading south with all of the speed they could muster. One way or another, this game of cat-and-mouse would end soon.",

But they knew they had no choice but to press on, for they were deep in Corsair waters, and there was no turning back.\n\n“There!” one of the Elven sailors shouted from the bow of the ship. He pointed to the south, his keen eyes spotting something through the night fog. “The *Stormcaller*! We’ve caught it!” The crew prepared for battle, and a surge of adrenaline coursed through them. They gained quickly on the *Stormcaller*, and could hear the raucous shouts, cries and curses coming from its raiders.\n\nSoon after, alarms sounded from the coast. The watch towers had spotted them.

        "doNotRead": "Sahír staggered in pain as he was dealt the final blow, leaning against a stone pillar for support. He clutched the black sword in his hands with surprising strength for one so mortally wounded. “No... The sword... is mine...” the captain stammered. The words came slowly for him, every breath wracked with pain.\n\nOne of the heroes approached Sahír warily. The captain’s blade was different from the cutlass he’d carried before. It was etched with runes and forged from a black metal the heroes did not recognize. Judging from its size and material, it was clear that this blade was the object in the black chest – the artifact Sahír was after all along. He turned towards Sahír with pity in his eyes. The captain had never been a good man, but the heroes could see now that his obsession for power had been warped by the artifact. Having traveled with the captain for a short time, they could see the madness had changed him. “What is this blade, truly?” the hero asked. “How did you know where to find it?”\n\nSahír laughed, as he always had in the face of death, although this time it didn’t seem like he would escape his fate. “You’re asking the wrong question,” he croaked, his sentence interrupted by bloody coughs. “Not what, but whose.”\n\n“Whose?” The hero repeated. He recalled Calphon’s visions and looked upon the blade once more, examining its dark runes. “This blade was not forged by Elves, Dwarves, or Man. Who forged it, then? Was it forged in old Númenor?”\n\nSahír grinned, backing away to the edge of the balcony overlooking the sea. “Aye, it was forged an age ago, by one who was very wise, deep in the counsel of the King, and skilled in the art of smithing.” The heroes’ eyes widened, as Lord Calphon had recounted to them the tale of the fall of Númenor. “It was forged by Sauron.”\n\nThe heroes finally understood. The Dark Lord’s power corrupted all it touched, and Sahír was no exception. “We cannot let the Enemy get ahold of this,” one of the heroes said, stepping forward and motioning to the blade. “Sahír, hand it over.” The captain shook his head and inched further backwards, leaning dangerously close to the edge of the balcony.\n\n“No!” he barked, clutching the blade closely. “I will not hand to you the instrument of my doom,” he said, grimacing. He leaned over the edge of the balcony and looked down to the sea and the sharp rocks below. “I am a Corsair. I shall have a Corsair’s death,” he exclaimed, grinning wickedly. “And I shall take the sword with me into the depths!”\n\nWith that, Captain Sahír closed his eyes and threw himself over the balcony, falling into the ocean below. The heroes ran to the edge, but they were too late.\n\n“So ends Captain Sahír of Umbar,” one of the heroes declared in pity for the fallen captain. Neither the captain’s body, nor the sword he carried, could be seen below the waves crashing against the rocks. They pushed the black chest over the edge of the balcony, and threw its matching key into the ocean as well, so as to remove all traces of the artifact from the city.\n\n“The voyage of the *Dream-chaser* is at an end as well,” one of the heroes added. The shouts of Corsairs were still near, and they were deep in enemy territory with little hope of escape.",

A desperate will to live had overtaken them, and they ran without thinking. Like hunted animals they fled deeper and deeper into the desert. Forgetting themselves and their weariness, the heroes ran and ran until at last their bodies collapsed from exhaustion. Months at sea, many fierce battles, and the shipwreck finally caught up with them, and the companions passed out on the sands as night deepened.\n\nWhen morning came, the harsh light of the sun wakened the heroes from their sleep, and they dragged their aching bodies to their feet. All around them was a vast desert. Sand dunes rolled away in every direction, like an endless arid sea.\n\n“Which way do we go?” asked the woman with the bow strapped to her back.\n\n“East,” replied their leader as he sheltered his eyes against the sun rising in that direction.\n\n“But our nearest ally lies to the north, in Gondor,” said another hero in surprise, “Should we not take the speediest way there?”\n\n“The speediest way would be to the west and the sea, but our ship has sunk and the Southrons still wait for us there,” said the leader. “North lies our destination, yet uncounted miles of harsh desert lie between us and there, and we have not the means to make such a journey. Our only hope is to travel the Harad Road, which lies to the east and runs north to Ithilien.”\n\n“Will not the Southrons seek us there as well?” asked the woman.\n\n“The Southrons must believe that the desert will defeat us, or they would have pursued us during the night while we slept. They clearly do not expect us to reach the other side.”\n\n“That may prove true enough,” said the third hero gruffly. “We have precious few supplies and little water.”\n\n“Then we will have to find more and be careful with what we have,” answered the leader, and with that he shouldered his gear and began walking east.

As they lay there, on the edge of death, one of the haves remarked bitterly, “What did we hope to find when we reached this road? There’s naught here but more sand.”\n\n“The people of Gondor built this road at the height of their power, at a time when they held sway in Harad,” replied the leader in a weak voice, his lips blistered and cracked. “It is the only thing friendly to us in all this land.”\n\n“Then I’m afraid we have no friends in Harad,” said the woman gravely. She pointed north with her finger and her arm trembled from the effort. “Look what the road bringst to us.”\n\nWith great effort, the leader propped himself up and strained his eyes northward. A caravan of Haradrim was travelling south along the road, drawing nearer. When he realized what he saw, the hero’s arms failed and he fell to the ground.\n\n“I have not the strength to fight, nor even to lift my sword,” he muttered in despair.\n\n“None of us do,” replied the woman, slumping onto the ground.\n\n“Then have we come all this way only to end here?” growled the third hero with impotent anger.\n\n“What will they do with us?” asked the woman.\n\n“Either kill us or take us captive. Perhaps to take as thralls to Mordor,” answered the leader with a raspy voice.\n\n“An inglorious end to our long adventure together,” grumbled the third.\n\nNobody made a reply.

        "flavorIntro": "The leader of the heroes awoke alone inside a large hut. The walls were made of dried mud and the roof was thatched straw, but it was no crude hovel he found himself in. A thick, woven curtain covered the doorway, and a beautifully crafted rug covered the dirt floor. From outside, he could hear the bleating of goats and the laughter of children.\n\nOn a wooden table by the hero’s bed was a loaf of bread and a cup of water. He tried to sit up to reach the water, but a wave of dizziness washed over him, and he slumped back down clutching his head.\n\nA tall, dark-skinned man dressed in red and gold pulled aside the curtain and entered the room; a Haradrim warrior holding a long, broad-headed spear.\n\nThe warrior leaned the spear against the wall by the door and held up his palm in a sign of peace. To the hero’s surprise, the Harad man spoke in the common tongue, “You are awake. Good. My son was afraid that you would die.”\n\n“Who are you?” asked the hero.\n\n“I am Kahliel,” he answered with a deep voice, “And this is my village. We brought you here after we found you in the desert.”\n\n“Then I am your prisoner,” said the hero warily.\n\nKahliel laughed, “It is not my custom to keep prisoners in my home, or give them my son’s bed to sleep in! I am chieftain of this tribe. You are my guest.”\n\nThe hero was confused. He was confident they would find no help in all Harad, and yet this man had rescued him from certain death.\n\n“Where are my friends?” the tired hero asked, forcing himself upright in the bed.\n\nKahliel handed him the cup of water and said, “They are safe. Each of your friends is with a member of my tribe as you are here with me. They are resting as you are.”\n\nThe hero accepted the drink, and after he had taken a little, he asked, “Why are you helping us?”\n\nKahliel pulled a chair next to the bed, sat down, and let out a long breath. When he looked at the hero the warmth in his eyes was gone and his face was grave.\n\n“We were returning from Mordor when we found you,” he said.\n\nThe hero’s hand clenched the cup tight at the naming of Mordor, but he said nothing and Kahliel continued:\n\n“Every year we pay tribute to the Dark Tower. Food and lumber that we must carry from our village here in the great forest, across the wide desert, to the fortress of Cirith Gurat in the Mountains of Shadow. It is a long journey and a heavy burden for my people. But if we refuse, the Dark Lord will send his Orcs and destroy us.”\n\n“Then the Haradrim serve Mordor only out of fear?” asked the hero, amazed by this revelation.\n\n“This is true for my tribe, but many others are eager to serve. Some worship the Dark Lord and seek his favor. They even turn against their own people and sell their children to Mordor,” he said with disgust.\n\n“Then you have taken a great risk by helping us, Kahliel. For we are enemies of Mordor,” replied the hero with both wonder and concern.\n\n“I have done more than that already,” said Kahliel, his head bowed as under a great weight. “I have defied the Orcs and endangered my people.”\n\nThe hero watched him with great interest, wondering what he had done. When Kahliel looked up, pain and anger were written in his furled brow.\n\n“They wanted my son,” he growled. “Those filthy mongrels demanded I give them my child with our next tribute, but I refused! I drew my sword and swore to sever the hand that reaches for my child.”\n\n“Then they will come for all of you,” said the hero in amazement.\n\n“Yes,” sighed Kahliel. “Very soon no place in all Harad will be safe for my tribe. That is why you are here. We need your help. For it is said among our people that Gondor still defies the Dark Lord, and keeps the lands behind them safe from his Orcs.”\n\nThere was a look of desperation in his eyes as he spoke. “Is this true?” he asked.\n\n“It is true,” answered the hero. “The men of Gondor hold the passages of the great river against the Enemy, and the lands to the west have peace.”\n\n“Then I think we can help each other,” said Kahliel with real hope returning to his face. He held out his hand as he continued, “If you will guide us to those lands, we will help you and your friends to return to your homes.”\n\nThe hero clasped the Haradrim’s hand and answered, “We will get there together.”\n\n—————\n\nThe heroes would not be ready to travel for several days, so Kahliel left them to rest while he and his people prepared for the journey. His village was built on the edge of the great southern jungle where the Mûmakil roamed and the hunters of Kahliel’s tribe went at times to hunt.\n\nIt was into the jungle that Kahliel took his three closest companions, members of his tribe, to gather food on the eve of their departure. They were following a forest trail back to the village with enough meat to last for a long journey when they heard the howling of Wargs and the shouting of Orcs.\n\n“They have come!” the chieftain shouted to his companions. “Hurry! Orcs are attacking our village!”\n\nThe hunters dropped their game, drew their weapons, and charged into the fray.",
        "ruling": "**Objective-Heroes**\n\nObjective-hero is a new card type in *The Long Arm of Mordor*. The four objective-heroes in this scenario represent the brave Haradrim of Kahliel’s tribe who are fighting against Sauron’s Orcs in order to save the heroes and escape from the oppressive rule of Mordor. An objective-hero is both an objective and a neutral hero. An objective-hero functions the same as a regular hero with the following exceptions: an objective-hero has no threat cost and does not count towards the hero limit of 3.\n\nAs a neutral hero, each objective-hero collects 1 resource at the beginning of the resource phase, and resources from its resource pool may be spent to pay for neutral player cards.\n\nWhen setting up *The Long Arm of Mordor*, each player is instructed to take control of an objective-hero. Starting with the first player, each player should choose 1 of the available objective-heroes in turn order. Then, any unused objective-heroes are removed from the game.\n\nEach objective-hero in *The Long Arm of Mordor* has the text: “**If (this hero) leaves play, you are eliminated from the game**.” This text cannot be modified in any way.\n\n**Heroes in the Staging Area**\n\nAt the beginning of *The Long Arm of Mordor*, the heroes are still recovering from their difficult desert crossing. To represent this in the scenario, the players are instructed to place their heroes in the staging area during setup. Stage 1A reads: “For the remainder of the game, heroes in the staging area are in play but under no player’s control, immune to player card effects, and their text boxes are considered to be blank.” This creates a lasting effect that applies to heroes while they are in the staging area.\n\nWhen an effect causes a player to take control of a hero in the staging area, that player moves that hero from the staging area to his play area. Once that hero is no longer in the staging area, the lasting effect created by stage 1A no longer applies to it.\n\nWhile a hero is under no player’s control, it does not collect resources during the resource phase.\n\nWhen a card effect refers to ownership of a hero, the player who ‘owns’ that hero is the player who selected that hero as one of his starting heroes during the game’s setup. If a hero in the staging area has its hit points reduced to 0, it is destroyed and placed in its owner’s discard pile.\n\n**Guarded Heroes**\n\nWhen the players advance to stage 3A, they are instructed to attach each hero in the staging area to a different Orc enemy in the staging area. Each hero attached to an Orc enemy is guarded by that enemy. While a hero is guarded by an enemy, it is treated like a guarded objective.\n\n**Stage Number**\n\nWhen a card refers to the “stage number” of a quest card, it is referencing the numerical value of the sequence in the upper left hand corner of that quest card.",
        "doNotRead": "From deep in the forest, the heroes watched the village burn. Bright red flames leapt up into the night sky as thatched roofs collapsed into ruined huts. They could hear the Orcs laughing as the flames spread across the boma. It was a horrible reminder of what fate awaited the enemies of Mordor if the defenders of the West should fail as they had this night.\n\nThe heroes had not yet recovered from their desert crossing and were forced to flee into the dense jungle. The Haradrim survivors were gathered around them, but their chieftain sat apart. He had incited the wrath of Mordor by refusing to surrender his child, and now he was certain his son was dead. There were many who were not able to escape the village before it was overrun.\n\n“What do we do now, Kahliel?” asked one of the fighters, Firyal was her name.\n\n“Find a new chieftain,” said Kahliel despondently, “I have shamed my fathers and brought ruin to our tribe.”\n\n“Mordor brought ruin to our tribe, not Kahliel,” replied Yazan, another of his warriors. “You were right not to give them your son. How could you do otherwise?”\n\n“Yazan is right,” echoed Jubayr, Kahliel’s trusted friend. “The Dark Lord would make us all his slaves whether we fight or not, so I say fight.”\n\n“Aye! And I say you are still our chieftain, Kahliel,” said Firyal proudly. “I have hunter beside you many times, and you never led us after the wrong trail. Lead us now!”\n\nKahliel lifted his head and the distant fires were reflected in his eyes. His face was pained yet determined. “Very well,” he said, “I will travel to Gondor with the northerners and any who will follow.”\n\nThere followed a silence us the members of Kahliel’s tribe considered the weight of their chieftain’s choice. The fires that burned their village roared in the distance.\n\n“I will go,” said Yazan, “But how shall we make such a journey without the supplies we had packed in the village?”\n\n“And how can we outrun the wolves of Mordor if they hunt for us on the road?” added Firyal.\n\n“The leagues that lie between us and Gondor are many and barren,” said Jubayr. “We cannot walk there.”\n\nKhaliel lifted his hand and his companions fell silent. “We will ride to Gondor,” he said, “ The Mûmakil dwell in this forest, along with the supplies we need. We will capture the beasts we need and ride them to Gondor.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The great jungle of Harad was unlike any forest the heroes had ever entered before. It was hot and the air was humid. Beads of sweat rolled down their legs as they made their way through the dense undergrowth. Leaves of every shape were packed together so closely that they could not see more than a few feet in front of them, and the forest canopy blotted out the sky leaving them with almost no way to navigate. If they had wandered into the forest alone, it is unlikely that they would have ever found their way out again.\n\nYet their Haradrim guides, Kahliel and his hunters, moved among the giant leaves and low hanging vines with confidence. This jungle was their hunting ground, and the prey which they now sought was an animal they had hunted many times before: the mighty Oliphaunt. A beast large enough for many men to ride upon its back, and strong enough to carry them all the way to Gondor. The Haradrim called the beasts Mûmakil and long ago learned the trick of capturing them and riding them. In times of war they built towers upon their backs from which to shoot arrows and hurl spears, but the people of Kahliel’s tribe also used them for traveling great distances, as they hoped to now.\n\nTheir village was destroyed. Sauron’s Orcs had come upon the boma by night and burnt it to the ground. Howling Wargs had pursued Kahliel’s people into the jungle. The heroes barely escaped along with the few survivors of Kahliel’s tribe. With no home to return to, Kahliel made the difficult decision to leave their homeland and make the long journey north to Gondor. There he hoped the heroes would earn his people safe passage into a new land where they would be free from the power of Mordor.\n\nBut to reach Gondor the heroes and their friends would have to cross the vast desert of Harad. There was no hope of making that journey on foot, so they entered the jungle to capture wild Mûmakil.\n\nEven for an experienced hunter like Kahliel, it was a dangerous undertaking. The jungle of Harad was home to all manner of deadly creatures, from stinging insects to prowling tigers. Kahliel did not have time to explain all the dangers of the jungle to the foreigners who were with him, so he bade them be silent and step where he stepped, and stop when he stopped. In this way the heroes followed their Haradrim guides through the jungle.\n\nAfter a few hours of speechless travel, their guide raised his hand to signal the heroes to stop. He then waved them over to where he stood and pointed at the ground. There was a large depression in the soft earth, big enough for a man to lay down in. “Mûmak,” whispered Kahliel. He looked up from the print and motioned with his eyes. The heroes followed his gaze into the jungle where they could see a trail rent in the undergrowth by enormous beast. Bent trees and crushed logs marked the Oliphaunt’s passing.\n\n“This track is at least one day old,” said Kahliel, speaking softly. “It leads deeper into the jungle. This is not good. Many apes live there. They do not like Haradrim or outsiders and will attack if threatened. There are other dangers too, so be alert. Follow me.”\n\nWith that, Kahliel resumed the hunt, and the heroes followed him.",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "The heroes could scarcely believe what they had accomplished. With the help of their Haradrim allies, they had captured several Mûmakil. Using the tribal knowledge of Kahliel’s people, they were able to bring the beasts down without harming them. Once on top of the Mûmak, Kahliel s tribesmen fitted each one with a harness that allowed them to control the enormous animal.\n\nThey had journeyed into the jungle on foot, but they rode out on the backs of the Oliphaunts. When they reached the jungle’s edge, they were shocked at how abruptly the lush growth ended. Once they cleared the treeline, the bright green of the forest was replaced by the light brown of the desert. League upon league of cracked earth and burning sand lay before them. Even with the strong mounts that they rode, it would be a long journey across Harad.",

        "flavorIntro": "Riding atop an Oliphaunt was a new experience for the heroes. It almost reminded them of sailing. They swayed from side to side with each lumbering step of their mount like on the deck of a ship, and the dunes below them rolled into the horizon like the waves of the sea. Overhead, the stars shone bright and the white light of the moon illuminated the desert around them.\n\nThey traveled mostly by night and rested by day to avoid the heat. They were amazed at how docile these giant creatures were once Kahliel and his men had fitted them each with a harness. The Mûmak responded to the rider’s every command. It was so simple, that Kahliel insisted the heroes try it for themselves. Their attempts provided some amusement for Kahliel’s men, but after a short while the heroes were driving the Oliphaunts with confidence.\n\n“Good,” said Kahliel clapping his hand on the hero’s back. “You drive well. Almost as good as my son,” he started to laugh, but it stuck in his throat and his voice trailed off.\n\nThe hero turned to look at him, but the chieftain would not meet his gaze. He stared into the distance, grief etched into his face. The hero chose not to say anything but turned his attention back to the task at hand. From his vantage point atop the Mûmak he had an impressive view of the desert. It seemed to go on forever. The ancient road beneath them stretched off into the distance where it was obscured in the darkness.\n\nAs the hero’s mind wandered over the endless sand, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He wasn’t sure what it was, but he turned around to see that Kahliel was also alert and looking behind them. Had he heard something?\n\nThen the sound came unmistakable: the eerie howl of a Warg. He couldn’t tell for certain what direction it came from; sound could travel for miles over this open ground.\n\nThe Warg’s cry was answered by another. The cry came from a different direction. Then, there was another louder howl. Nearer to them but still hidden from view. Soon the whole desert was alive with the sound of Wargs. Though he could not see them yet, the hero knew: they were being hunted.\n\nEven from atop his towering Mûmak, the hero felt afraid. Out here in the shelterless desert, there was nowhere to hide. And where the Warg howls, there the Orc prowls. The hero gave the reigns a shake and urged his mount faster: it would be a race to the river Harnen.",
        "ruling": "**Preparing the Orcs’ Area**\n\nThe setup for this scenario instructs the players to “Prepare the Orcs’ area” To prepare the Orcs’ area, the players must prepare a second quest deck consisting of stage 1C, stage 2C, stage 3C, and stage 4C, in that order. (The quest stages labeled stage 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A are used in the player’s quest deck, as normal.)\n\n**The Orcs’ Area**\n\nThe Orcs’ area is a new play area, separate from the staging area, that represents the Orcs’ pursuit as they try to overtake the players on their journey through Harad. As the players advance through their quest deck, the Orcs also advance through their quest deck, attempting to reach the same stage as the players and defeat it before they do. The quest stage on top of the Orcs’ quest deck is called “the Orcs’ stage.” Each of these quest stages has the following text: “**Forced**: At the end of the quest phase, discard the top card of the encounter deck. Place X progress on this stage, where X is the discarded card’s [threat] plus the total [threat] in the Orcs’ area.” Every round, this effect causes the Orcs to make progress on their stage, just as the players try to make progress on their quest stage. If the Orcs’ quest stage has progress on it equal to or above its quest points, they advance to the next quest stage in the same way players would, first advancing to the “C” side of the next stage, resolving its effects, and then advancing to the “D” side.\n\nWhile the Orcs are at a different quest stage than the players, cards in the Orcs’ area are immune to player card effects, cannot leave the Orcs’ area, and are not considered to be in the staging area (and thus do not contribute their [threat] to the total [threat] in the staging area). Players are considered to be at “the same stage” as the Orcs if their main quest stage’s name and number match the Orcs’ quest stage (“2B–Racing North” and “2D–Racing North,” for example).\n\n**When the players and the Orcs are at the same quest stage, cards in the Orcs’ area are no longer immune to player card effects, can leave the Orcs’ area, and are considered to be in the staging area** (and thus **do** contribute their [threat] to the total [threat] in the staging area). Thus, when the Orcs catch up to the players, the players can engage enemies in the Orcs’ area and travel to locations in the Orcs’ area.",

Angry shouts and howls pursued them from the southern shore. The Wargs paced to and fro along the edge of the water and Orcs shot arrows from recurved bows. The black-feathered arrows fell in the water around the heroes. A few stuck harmlessly in the thick hide of the Mûmakil.\n\nAnd so the heroes crossed safely to the north side of the river and into the land of Harondor The servants of Mordor on the further shore hated and feared the water and would not dare to swim. Instead, their pursuers would he forced to travel many miles to the Ford of Harnen. By the time the Wargs were able to pick up their trail again, the heroes would be far away.\n\nBut their journey was not yet finished. They had escaped the servants of Mordor that pursued them across Harad, but now they drew nearer to the Black Land itself. The heroes would have to travel many leagues within sight of the Mountains of Shadow in order to reach Gondor. Many foul creatures long ago descended from those dark heights to dwell in Harondor. At night they crawled out from dark pits to prey upon the unwary, and as the sky darkened around the heroes and their allies, hundreds of hungry eyes watched them set up camp.",

They heard screams and the sound of scuffling, but they could see nothing in the utter darkness of the night. Kahliel called to his men to organize them, but his shouts were drowned out by the loud braying of the Mûmakil. That soon faded as the frightened beasts tore their harnesses and stampeded away into the desert.\n\nWhen the morning came, the heroes searched the ground for signs of what had transpired in the night. They found strange animal tracks at the edge of their camp, and heavy lines in the sand indicating that some of their company had been dragged away.\n\n“I don’t recognize these markings,” said one of the heroes, lightly touching one of the animal tracks.\n\n“There’s no blood on the sand,” observed another. “What kind of animal takes its prey without spilling any blood?” he asked.\n\n“The great spiders of the desert,” answered Firyal. “They use their poison to paralyze their victims, then drag them back to their den to eat them.”\n\n“Then we must follow the trail to their lair and rescue our friends!” exclaimed the first hero, standing up and shaking the sand from his hands.\n\n“Just so,” said Firyal. “What say you Kahliel: Do we pursue the Mûmakil that fled in the night? Or do we seek the spiders in their den?”\n\nThe Haradrim chief narrowed his eyes and gazed into the desert, then he looked at the tracks at his feet. “The Mûmakil have fled beyond our reach, but even if there was hope to recapture them, we could not abandon our friends,” he said. “Gather your weapons. We follow the spiders.”",

While Off Track is in play, players cannot place progress on the main quest because they are searching in the wrong direction. While On Track is in play, progress can be placed on the main quest, but the scenario becomes more challenging because the spiders grow more vicious as the heroes draw closer to their lair.",
        "doNotRead": "The heroes found their friends bound by giant webs to the walls of the spiders’ cavern lair, but there were others there too.\n\n“Kahliel?” cried one. “My chief, is that you?”\n\nKahliel turned to see who it was that called his name. “Lorgan?” he exclaimed in astonishment.\n\n“Yes! It’s me!” answered a Haradrim man bound with spider cords. “And Hadid is here too! Look Hadid, our chieftain has come to rescue us.”\n\n“We thought you were dead.” said Hadid with wonder at seeing her chieftain alive, and in the spiders’ den.\n\n“We thought the same of you. How did you come to be here?” Kahliel asked as he cut them loose.\n\n“After the Orcs attacked the village, they took some of us captive,” answered Lorgan. “They put us in wagons and brought us to their tower in the Ephel Duath.”\n\n“Cirith Gurat?” asked Kahliel.\n\n“Yes,” said Lorgan. “They put us to work in the mines below the fortress, but we found a way out: a narrow passage that opened into the mountains. We climbed down and fled into the desert. The spiders must have captured us in our sleep because we woke up here.”\n\n“Then there are others of our tribe still in Cirith Gurat?” asked Kahliel.\n\n“Yes, my chief,” said Hadid. “Your son is there too.”\n\nKahliel froze. His heart dropped into his stomach. “Abaan?” he whispered, eyes wide with fear.\n\nThe Haradrim chieftain staggered out of the spider’s cavern and braced himself against the entrance. “My son is alive, and a captive of the Orcs,” he groaned and stared across the desert plain towards the Mountains of Shadow. Turning to face his companions, he continued: “I must rescue him.”\n\n“Is this possible?” asked one of the heroes. “He is a captive of Cirith Gurat.”\n\n“My chief, we do not have the strength to assault the fortress.” added Jubayr.\n\n“I am his father!” Kahliel shouted, and the others were silent.\n\n“I must at least try,” he stammered. “But the burden is mine alone. I do not ask any of you to come with me.”\n\n“You shame me, Kahliel,” said Jubayr. “I only meant to say that we need a plan.”\n\n“Quite right,” added the hero. “You rescued us from the desert and saved our lives. It is our duty to help you in your time of need, but we need a way into the fortress.”\n\n“Can we not enter in through the opening Lorgan and Hadid used to escape?” asked Firyal.\n\n“Perhaps.” answered the hero. “But the Orcs are certain to have noticed their escape by now, and their patrols will be doubled. If we are discovered, there will be no hope of rescue or escape.” he added thoughtfully.\n\n“Then we must find another way in,” said Firyal, “but how?”\n\n“We will enter through the front gate,” said Kahliel gazing into the distance again. This time his eyes were focused on a distant caravan coming up the Harad road. “The Black Serpent brings his tribute to Mordor as we speak. We will ambush his caravan, and march into Cirith Gurat under his banner.”",

        "flavorIntro": "“There is an old fortress at the crossroads yonder,” Kahliel pointed towards a rise in the distance, “on the other side of that ridge, where the Harad road meets the road to Cirith Gurat. The Black Serpent will camp there tonight.”\n\n“How do you know he will stay there?” asked one of the heroes with him. They were crouched next to each other atop a low hill in the desert watching the Serpent’s caravan as it followed the northward road and disappeared from sight behind the opposite ridge.\n\n“That is where we camp when we take our tribute to Mordor. All Haradrim do this,” answered Kahliel. His eyes were focused keenly on the caravan. The sun was lowering in the sky behind them, but there was enough light for him to count silhouettes. He wanted to know how many warriors were in the Serpent’s entourage before planning his raid.\n\n“Should we not attack them before they reach the safety of the fortress?” the hero asked.\n\n“No,” said Kahliel, “If we attack them on the open plain, they will scatter and we will not catch them. If we wait until they are inside the fort, then they cannot flee.”\n\n“But how will we enter the fort?” asked the hero.\n\n“The crossroads fort is a ruin: it has walls but no gate. The Haradrim camp there for the well.”\n\n“Then we attack through the gate and leave them nowhere to run,” the hero voiced his ally’s plan.\n\n“Just so,” said Kahliel.\n\nThe two warriors shared an understanding glance. Since making the decision to travel north together, Kahliel and the heroes had hunted Mûmakil together in the jungle, fought side-by-side against the Orcs upon the desert plain, and rescued their friends from the spiders’ den. Each one of these encounters built trust between them and respect for each other’s abilities.\n\nBut this ambush would be different; The Black Serpent and his men were Haradrim. The hero couldn’t help but wonder how that would change things in battle, so he spoke with Kahliel as they descended from their lookout: “The men in that caravan are not Orcs or spiders, Kahliel. Are you certain that you can go through with this?”\n\nKahliel stopped on the hillside to face the hero. “They are worse than Orcs. Worse than spiders!” he replied sternly. His eyes were furious, but he kept his voice level. “The spider is a mindless beast. It kills only to eat. There is no malice in this. The Orc is a slave, bound to the will of The Dark One. It has no choice but to do its Master’s work. But The Black Serpent is worse than both because he is free to choose, and he chooses to serve Mordor. He worships The Dark One and dishonors his people by making them his thralls. I will not hesitate to strike him, nor will any who follow me.”\n\nThe hero nodded and they resumed their quiet descent back to camp. Whatever happened after their raid began, the hero was confident that he could trust his Haradrim allies in battle.",

        "doNotRead": "“The Black Serpent has escaped,” one of the heroes informed Kahliel in the aftermath of the skirmish.\n\n“Then he is gone,” replied Kahliel. “We have no means to pursue. Still we have his banner and his caravan, so we proceed to Cirith Gurat.”\n\n“He may ride to the fortress and alert the Orcs,” cautioned the hero.\n\n“No,” said Kahliel. “He is too proud to embarrass himself in front of his Master’s slaves that way. He will ride to his city, gather such soldiers as he has, and he will return here in wrath.”\n\n“Then we must be far from here when he comes,” said the hero.\n\n“Just so,” said Kahliel. “Let us move quickly to gather the Serpent’s things. Have each man strip one of the fallen and don his armor. I will wear the Serpent’s garb and deliver the tribute to Cirith Gurat.”\n\nThere were not enough disguises for all of the fighters in their company. Furthermore, there were many who were injured or otherwise unable to fight. So the heroes counseled Kahliel that he should appoint some of his warriors to take their camp further north and wait for them there.\n\nThe chieftain agreed and gave orders for his people to abandon the cross-roads fort and seek shelter further north. Kahliel told his people that if he did not return from the Orc fortress in two nights, they should continue north to Gondor without them. And with that, Kahliel and the heroes raised the banner of The Black Serpent and drove the stolen caravan along the road to Cirith Gurat.",

        "flavorIntro": "The tower of Cirith Gurat rose higher as the caravan drove towards the gate. Not as tall or mighty as Minas Ithil, it was still of Númenórean design, built after the fall of Sauron when Gondor kept watch on the land of Mordor. It was situated on the southernmost edge of the Ephel Dúath, where the mountain range bent away eastwards. From here the men of Gondor would have guarded the narrow passage into Mordor and kept watch over the land of Harondor. But as with Minas Ithil and many others, the tower of Cirith Gurat was captured by the Enemy when the vigil of Gondor failed and Sauron reentered the Black Land.\n\nSince that time, the tower had become an abode for Orcs and other evil creatures. The heroes could see them now: Orc sentries in sable armor standing atop the wall. Each of them was armed with a bow of equal height and a quiver of black-feathered arrows. Their eyes watched the caravan advance up the steep rampart that led to the tower gate.\n\nAs they drew near, Kahliel put the Serpent’s horn to his lips and blew a long note. The loud blast of an Orc horn sounded its reply from atop the wall. There was a rumble from inside the fortress and the drawbridge was lowered into place on mighty chains.\n\nPassing over the bridge, the caravan entered the courtyard through the gate. Slanted eyes watched them through the murder holes, and a large Warg snarled at them from its resting place inside the entrance. The heroes were disguised in the uniforms of The Black Serpent and their faces were covered by the black masks worn by his men so that only their eyes were visible. Kahliel himself wore The Black Serpent’s armor and carried the summons from Mordor. He handed the scroll to the Orc captain who approached him. The Orc didn’t bother to read them but growled in the common speech, “You’re late.”\n\n“We were attacked by bandits on the road,” replied Kahliel.\n\n“Were you now?” the Orc snarled. “And who would dare to attack The Black Serpent on the road to Mordor?” he asked mockingly.\n\n“Fools who are dead,” answered Kahliel. “They tried to steal the tribute that we have brought your Master, and they paid with their lives.”\n\n“Oh ho!” laughed the Orc. “So the Serpent has fangs after all! Well lads, better watch yourselves ‘round this lot!”\n\nThere was a horrible chorus of laughter from the Orcs gathered around them, but Kahliel was unmoved.\n\n“You will show me your dungeon while your soldiers unload the wagons,” he told the captain.\n\n“Will I now?” said the Orc amused. “And why would I do that?”\n\n“Because those are your orders,” he said, pointing to the sealed parchment in the Orc’s hand. “Read them yourself.”\n\nThe captain looked at the scroll with frustration, then looked back at Kahliel and snarled, “No need for that. If you want to visit the dungeon, my boys will be glad to show you. Just don’t do anything funny, or you may end up staying longer than you wish!”\n\n“Gharl!” he shouted to one of his soldiers, “Take these men below and show them the dungeons. The rest of you maggots get to work unloading these wagons!”\n\nA scar-faced Orc with long, loping arms ran over with an iron ring of keys, unlocked a heavy wooden door, and led them down to the dungeons.",
        "ruling": "**The Captives of Cirith Gurat**\n\nIn “The Dungeons of Cirith Gurat,” players attempt to rescue their captive friends from the fortress of the Orcs. To help represent the the captives’ plight, The Captives of Cirith Gurat objective is added to the staging area during setup. It reads: “While a character is attached to an encounter card, it is considered to be a guarded objective with a blank text box.” This means that characters who are captured and guarded by encounter cards lose their card type, and their player card status, and gain the objective card type instead. When a guarded objective is ‘rescued’ and returned to its owner’s control, that card regains its card type and player card status.",
        "doNotRead": "The sun was rising as the heroes led the rescued captives away from the fortress of Cirith Gurat. They chose a winding path through the foothills of the Ephel Dúath. It was difficult and slow going, but the deep crags and giant boulders at the mountains’ feet hid them from the watchful eyes of the tower. The Orcs would not pursue them by day, not while the sun blazed overhead, but they could mark their trail easily enough if they set out across the sand too early. So they stuck to the rocky path and quietly made their way north.\n\nAround midday they stopped in a low valley to rest. The heroes went from captive to captive, dressing wounds and comforting frightened refugees. Kahliel sat apart and held his son to his chest. When they had found Abaan in the dungeon of the Orcs, there had been no time for Kahliel to comfort his boy. He was never more afraid than in that moment. His only concern was getting out of the fortress with his son alive. But now that Cirith Gurat was hidden from view by the Mountains of Shadow, the weight of what they had accomplished settled in and Kahliel’s composure finally crumbled. He held his son and wept.\n\nIt was still many leagues to Gondor, and the Orcs would undoubtedly pursue them once night fell, but in that moment Kahliel did not care. His son was alive and unhurt. Together they cried tears of joy and anguish.",

        "doNotRead": "After the din of battle faded and the enemy was driven back from the Crossings at Poros, there was an uncomfortable silence as the Gondorians who guarded the ford exchanged looks with the Haradrim who followed the heroes across. Nervous glances were cast from soldier to refugee and back. As Kahliel marked the mistrust in the Gondorians’ eyes he grew afraid that his people might have risked everything to reach this point only to be turned away. He looked at the heroes who had traveled here with him and wondered if they would abandon him now that they were safe.\n\n“Greetings,” said a Gondorian, breaking the silence. He spoke to the heroes in the common speech, but his eyes looked warily at the Haradrim who huddled together by the river bank. “I am Targon, Captain of the Crossing. Who are these people with you? And what is their business here?”\n\nKahliel noticed that Targon did not sheathe his blade and neither did his men, though they had lowered them since the fight. The heroes sheathed their weapons, and one of them held out his palm in token of peace before speaking, “Well met Targon of Gondor. This is Kahliel, chieftain of his tribe, and these are all that is left of his people. Their village was destroyed by Orcs after they rescued us from the desert and sheltered us in their homes. They have traveled many leagues with us to seek refuge in the land of Gondor.”\n\nWonder filled Targon’s eyes as he listened to the hero’s story, but he remained cautious. “How did you come to be in Far Harad yourselves?” he asked.\n\n“We set sail from Mithlond to avenge Lord Calphon after he was murdered by Corsairs in an attack on the Grey Havens,” answered the hero. “We pursued his killers all the way to Umbar where justice was done to the pirates who carried out the raid. But our ship was sunk and we were stranded in the City of Corsairs, so we fled into the desert. There we would have died if not for this man.” The hero put his hand on Kahliel’s shoulder.\n\n“The Lord Calphon is dead?” said Targon. “That is ill news, and you have done well to avenge it.” He paused a moment to consider what was said before passing his judgment, “You and your companions are free to enter the land of Gondor, but I must detain the Haradrim here; for we have not had dealings with the people of Harad since the rule of the Stewards began. It is for the Lord Denethor to decide their fate.”\n\n“Then take us to Lord Denethor by the speediest way, Captain Targon,” urged the hero. “And let Kahliel come with, so that we might plead his people’s case before the Steward.”\n\nThe captain was surprised by the hero’s loyalty for the Haradrim. “Very well,” he replied. “Their chieftain will represent his people before the Steward, but no others. The rest must surrender their weapons and remain here.”\n\nThere was some commotion among the Haradrim when they heard this, and Kahliel held his son close to his side. The Gondorians stepped forward to collect their weapons, and they looked at the heroes with nervous eyes. The heroes nodded and the Haradrim reluctantly began to offer up their weapons.\n\nCaptain Targon extended his hand towards Abaan and motioned for Kahliel to let him go. “The boy will be safe here under my care,” he started to say, but Kahliel stepped in front of his son and his hand went to the hilt of his sword. Death was in his eyes.\n\nCaptain Targon stepped back and shouted “Guards!”\n\nThey might have come to unhappy blows if the hero had not thrown himself between them with his hands up. “Hold!” he shouted. “Hold!” He looked at Kahliel and said, “Be still! This man is not our enemy.”\n\nThe chieftain’s eyes glowed hot and his nostrils flared, but he relaxed his grip and lowered his arm, never taking his gaze off the Captain.\n\nThe hero looked at Targon and explained, “The boy is his son, Abaan. Kahliel thought him dead after the assault on their village. He risked everything to rescue him from the Orcs in Cirith Gurat. You cannot ask them to be separated.”\n\nCaptain Targon only took his eyes off Kahliel for a second to glance at the boy, then to the hero, and back to Kahliel. When he saw that Kahliel had relaxed his weapon arm, he signaled his men to stand down with a wave of his arm and sheathed his sword. “I also have a son,” he said, speaking to Kahliel. “I don’t know what I would do if he were taken by Orcs, but if I had him back again I would never let go. Your son may go with you.”\n\nAn expression of gratitude replaced the fire that was in Kahliel’s eyes and he raised his palms in a gesture of peace. Then he slowly drew his sword and presented the hilt to Targon. As he surrendered his weapon to the Gondorian he said, “May you live to see your grandchildren’s children.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The sun shone brightly on the wide green pastures of the Anduin river valley. The tall grass swayed with a gentle breeze. Summer was already giving way to fall in the Misty Mountains to the west, but the air was still warm in the Vales of Anduin. It was pleasant travel weather for a small band of adventurers who were making their way north along the western shore of the mighty Anduin. They had already come a long way. The tale of their journey spanned from the cold of Angmar to the coasts of Andrast, and from the desert of Harad to the high walls of Minas Tirith.\n\nIt was a hero’s tale: This company of adventurers had brought with them from the far south of Middle-earth the remnant of a Haradrim tribe whose village was destroyed when they defied Mordor. They had depended upon one another over a long and perilous journey from Far Harad to Pelargir, but they were not permitted to remain in Gondor. The steward of that land remained suspicious of the Haradrim even after the heroes’ account of their bravery, but the Lord Denethor had granted them safe passage north. They were escorted to the city of Edoras in Rohan where they sought an audience with King Theoden, but it was the king’s advisor, Gríma, who heard their plight and denied them refuge.\n\nOnce again the heroes and their Haradrim allies were forced to continue north. Their hope now was to seek asylum for their friends with King Brand in Dale, but it was still a long and dangerous journey across Wilderland and winter was nigh. The Haradrim, unaccustomed to the harsh cold of a Rhovanion winter, would be ill-suited to such a journey, so the heroes had left them on the northern border of Lothlórien in the care of the Galadhrim. The Lord and Lady of the Golden Wood would not allow strangers into their realm, but they agreed to shelter the refugees through the winter while the heroes traveled to see King Brand on their behalf.\n\nSo it was that the heroes now traveled north through the Vales of Anduin on their way to the Old Ford. The Beornings safe-guarded the passage of the river there and many small Woodmen villages dotted the west river bank along the way. It would he an easy journey through pleasant country Or so they thought.\n\nTheir troubles began when they saw a Warg-rider atop a low foothill of the mountains to the west. As soon as they spotted the Goblin, he turned his mount and rode out of sight down the other side of the hill. They did not see him again that day or the next, but it left them ill at ease and they took turns keeping watch at night. It was a good thing they did because on the third night the lookout saw a Mountain-troll descend from the hills and walk within a stone’s throw from their camp. The lookout had fitted an arrow to her bow and was ready to wake her companions when she realized that it had not seen them and was heading south. When she shared this news with the rest of the company the next morning, it caused a stir.\n\n“A stray Warg-rider is one thing, but Trolls are another!” exclaimed one of the adventurers.\n\n“We do not know the Goblin was a stray,” counteredhis companion. “I still say it was a scout and a sign that there are more nearby.”\n\n“It is unusual to see these creatures this far south and on the west side of the river,” agreed the first.\n\n“I believe some evil is afoot. We must stay alert now; this land is no longer safe for us,” offered a third companion. All nodded their heads in agreement. They made no more conversation as they broke camp that morning, and they remained silent and alert as they resumed their journey north.",

The huge Beorning gave Haldan a clap on the back that nearly topled the Woodman. “Scraps like that make me feel young again,” he added with a giant grin.\n\nHaldan offered a tired smile in return and massaged his shoulder where Grimbeorn had slapped him. “That may be,” he said, “but doesn’t it worry you? It isn’t like the Goblins to venture so far south, or to attack those who can fight back.”\n\n“Aye,” said Grimbeorn thinking about it now. “It didn’t feel like one of their raids. It was more like an act of desperation than an attack. There’ve been a fair few of these Goblins and other creatures trying to sneak across the Ford recently. It’s as if they’re trying to get away from something up north.”\n\n“But what could be driving Goblins and Trolls from their holes in the mountains?” asked Haldan.\n\nGrimbeorn and the companions all looked at each other, but no one offered any guesses as the weight of the question sank in. They all felt it though: the foreboding of worse to come.",

        "flavorIntro": "The vast and dangerous forest of Mirkwood lay before the heroes like a wall of green and black. The Forest Road ran the length of the woods from the Old Ford to the River Running, but it was a perilous crossing. The fortress of Dol Guldur to the south had again become a place of evil and its influence could be felt throughout the darkening woods, and to the north were the many webs and snares of the giant spiders. To wander off the trail in either direction was to risk becoming lost forever, and it was a long way to the other side of the forest.\n\nThe heroes knew all this but were determined to reach Dale and have an audience with King Brand, so they thanked Grimbeorn and the Beornings for their aid and entered the woods. Haldan went with them. The Woodman had made this journey before and the adventurers welcomed his assistance.\n\n“It is many days travel to the eastern edge of the forest,” said Haldan. “If we stick to the road we should not have any trouble. Traffic has lessened since the shadow returned to Mirkwood, but the trail is still easy to follow during the day. At night we camp and dare not move.”\n\nThe first few days were uneventful, but as they moved deeper into the woods the closeness of the forest became unbearable until each member of the company traveled in silent torment. The gloom of Mirkwood clouded their minds as well as their senses until the memory of sunlight faded into a dream.\n\nThat night great weariness overcame the adventurers and they fell into enchanted sleep. Haldan had first watch and as he struggled to keep his eyes open his head leaned heavily on the pommel of his axe. His mind was beginning to wander when he saw the horrible shape of a spider illuminated by the orange glow of the fire. “What a terrible vision,” he thought to himself as he stared into the bulbous eyes of the beast. It wasn’t until he saw another spider bite one of his sleeping companions that he cried out in terror and roused the others. A bitter and desperate battle ensued as the heroes struggled to cast off their weariness and defend themselves...",

It had been a harrowing journey through Mirkwood, but they had finally reached the eastern edge of the forest. They came now to the shore of the River Running, and, as luck would have it, a trade vessel sailed into view on its way north.\n\nThey hailed the boat and her crew steered the vessel to shore in response. The captain was a friendly Barding who welcomed them aboard and offered them safe passage in exchange for a reasonable amount of their gold. The heroes happily accepted and began loading their things onto the boat.\n\n“This is where we part ways,” said Haldan. “The river will carry you north to Lake-town and then to Dale, but my home lies back west.”\n\nOne of the heroes clasped hands with the Woodman and said, “Thank you for your help. You are a brave man, Haldan. I wish you safe travel on your return journey.”\n\nWith that, the heroes climbed aboard the Bardings’ boat and sailed north as Haldan waved goodbye from the shore.",

        "flavorIntro": "“Welcome, guests,” said King Brand to the small party of adventurers who had just arrived in Dale. The king sat upon a wooden throne at the far end of his great hall. About him were the knights of his guard in fine mail. Rich tapestries hung from the walls, and the king drank from a golden cup. “I understand you have traveled a great distance and through many perils to reach me. The hospitality of Dale is yours. Tell me: what errand brings you to my realm?”\n\nOne of the heroes stepped forward and knelt at the foot of the throne. “My lord,” she began, “our road has indeed been long and perilous. From Far Harad we escaped the grasp of Mordor with a tribe of noble Haradrim who aided us in our moment of need. They forfeited their home when they joined with us and now they are a houseless people in a foreign land. Word of your prosperity reached us in the south and we have traveled here on their behalf. King Brand, will you allow them to settle in Dale?”\n\nThe king stroked his beard as he considered all that had been said. “This is no small thing that you ask of me. Even here in the north we have heard tales of the savage Haradrim. It is a marvel to my ears to hear you speak of them as you do, but I do not doubt the truth of your words. The journey you have undertaken on their behalf speaks to their credit.”\n\nKing Brand paused for a moment before continuing, “It is timely that you arrived when you did for I have need of heroes such as you: Something drives the fell mountain creatures from the north and into my realm. An entire village was reported destroyed only yesterday. There were no survivors to tell the tale and the knights of my house are already stretched thin defending the other outlying villages. That is why I need you to investigate this attack and discover those who are responsible. I must secure the borders of my kingdom before I can admit your friends to settle here. What say you?”\n\nThe hero rose from where she was kneeling, drew the sword from her scabbard and held it aloft as she spoke her answer, “We will go at once to deal with this threat to your realm and will not return until it is done.”\n\nKing Brand also stood and said, “After it is done, you will send for your friends, and they will have a new home in my land.”",

As it lay there, dying, the companions caught their breath and marveled at the monster they had slain.\n\n“Surely this was the beast that terrorized the borders of Brand’s realm!” said one of the heroes triumphantly.\n\n“Indeed, not since Smaug the Golden has a dragon such as this been seen in Middle-earth,” added another. “This must be what drove the Goblins out of the mountains.”\n\nThe adventurers were all in agreement when a horrible, gurgling laughter interrupted their conversation. The fire-drake coughed and cackled, “Fools! When my mother learns of my death, she will set all Wilderland ablaze!”\n\nThe heroes looked with wonder and horror as the wounded fire-drake summoned the last ounce of its strength to glare at them. The only fire left within the beast was the rage in its eyes as it cursed its enemies: “Your cities will burn! She will leave... nothing green... alive...” it sputtered and died, and its head dropped back to the ground.\n\nThere was a long silence as each member of the company reeled at the dragon’s words.\n\n“It lies,” said one of the companions at last. “It was an evil creature, and it means to rob us of our victory with empty threats.”\n\n“Nay,” replied another. “My heart wishes that were true, but it warns me otherwise. The creature was evil, and evil is wont to boast. This beast could not but tell us the truth in order to ease the sting of its defeat.”\n\n“If that is true, then we must seek the mother before she hears of what has happened here, or else the Bardings and many more will pay the price for our victory,” added a third.\n\n“But where do we find the mother?” asked the first. “Wilderland is a vast and untamed country. She could be anywhere.”\n\n“Wilderland is vast, but a dragon cannot go long unnoticed,” answered the second companion. “I believe we have felt her presence on our journey already. It must have been the mother that chased the creatures from the mountains, so that is where we shall seek her: in The Withered Heath, where the dragons breed.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes had already been traveling for days when they reached the first foothills of the Grey Mountains. Their journey across the barren lands between the Iron Hills and the Ered Mithrin had been uneventful except for the weather. It had rained in torrents, soaking the travelers’ heavy cloaks and leaving them wet and miserable.\n\nAs they began to climb the rising slopes of the Grey Mountains, the rain turned to snow; a welcome change if not for the cold that came with it. The early frost had only just descended on Wilderland below, but already in the stony heights of the Ered Mithrin the chill winds of winter were blowing and biting at the heroes’ faces.\n\nNevertheless, the adventurers climbed on. The fate of Rhovanion depended on them. Somewhere in this wide mountain range lurked a terrible danger: an ancient Dragon whose scion they had cut down in the Dwarven mines beneath the Iron Hills. The dying beast warned them his mother would seek revenge when she learned of his death, and the heroes feared that all Wilderland would suffer if they did not find her first.\n\nSo they climbed in search of the Withered Heath, a long valley that lay amid the eastern arms of the Grey Mountains, where the Dragons were said to breed. After several days of navigating steep cliffs and narrow paths, the heroes reached the summit and looked down on the vale they sought: an ashen plain of charred, lifeless rock. There were no Dragons to be seen, but plenty of Dragon sign. As they descended into the burnt valley, they could see that the vast majority of tracks were those of hatchlings - small prints, about the size of a bear’s, leading this way and that from the scattered remains of large eggs. But after some searching they found one large set of tracks that led west and up back into the mountains.\n\nAfter a short rest in a low dale among the charred rocks of the Withered Heath, the heroes resumed their hunt and followed the larger Dragon tracks they had found. They were each happy to leave the scorched vale behind them, but they all knew that greater danger still waited for them amid the cold heights surrounding the Withered Heath...",

All the others were but hatchlings.”\n\nThere was a brief silence as the adventurers contemplated this question when, from a dark corner of the Dragon’s lair, there came a shuffling noise. The heroes wheeled around with their weapons ready, to see a large Goblin stepping forward from the shadows with his arms held outward in token of surrender.\n\n“Yrch!” shouted one of the heroes, and he drew an arrow back with his bow, ready to fire.\n\n“Hold!” cried the Orc in a hoarse voice, “I can tell you where to find the Dragon you seek!”\n\nThe archer aimed at the Goblin’s chest and ordered him to speak: “Tell us what you know of this Dragon, and how you know it.”\n\nThe Goblin laughed bitterly and said, “Sure, sure. And while I’m at it, why don’t I tell you where I buried my loot after I raided the Woodmen so you can have all my secrets and be done with me? Garn! Urdug’s not stupid! I know yer gonna kill me once I tell you what I know.”\n\nThe bowman relaxed his draw, lowered his bow, and said, “Very well. I promise no harm will come to you if you speak truthfully, though it would be the first time I’ve heard an Orc do so.”\n\n“Well, that’s better!” said Urdug. He sat down on the Dragon’s corpse and gave it a pat. “You make short work of Dragons it seems, and that’s good cause I know one that needs killin’. The same one as you want dead I’ll wager: a great-big, fire-breather. Calls herself Dagnir the Terrible. She ran me and my boys out of our home in Gundabad months ago when she came on us in the early morning.”\n\n“Gundabad!” exclaimed one of the adventurers. “The Goblins stole Gundabad from the Dwarves ages ago. Serves you right!”\n\n“Pah! If the those long-beard wanted it, they should have fought harder to keep it,” laughed Urdug. “It belongs to the Goblins now.”\n\n“From your own account, it sounds like it belongs to Dagnir,” replied the hero sharply.\n\nUrdug stopped laughing and glared at her. “For the moment,” he said coldly. There was a tense pause before he laughed bitterly and continued, “I imagine she’s made herself a nice bed of treasure in the great hall by now. Probably made the Goblins drag it all up from the deeps for her.”\n\n“Goblins yet live there with the Dragon?” asked one of the companions with bewilderment.\n\n“Cowardly maggots!” Urdug exclaimed. “Lost their nerve at the first sound of her roar. Some fled south while others threw down their weapons and begged for mercy. Pah!” he spat. “I let out with the few who stayed loyal, but they’re mostly dead now. We fled out the secret door. The rising sun burnt our eyes, but we kept on. We came this way looking for a new home, but all we found was more Dragons.”\n\nUrdug regarded the Dragon carcass under him. “This one ate five of my boys after we stumbled into her cave.”\n\nOne of the heroes turned to her friends and said, “If all this is true, then we need to journey to Gundabad and find this Dagnir before she grows restless of her new home.”\n\nThen, turning back to Urdug she added, “And you, Urdug, will be our guide.”",

You’ll have to kill me.”\n\n“Very well,” replied one of the heroes as he drew his dagger from its sheath.\n\n“Wait, wait, wait!” cried Urdug, falling to his knees. “There’s another way! A secret way only Urdug knows! If you kill me, you won’t find it!”\n\n“What secret way?” asked the hero with his knife to the Goblin’s throat.\n\n“There’s a side door, a secret entrance that the Dwarves built – only I know where it is,” said Urdug, speaking quickly. “You can’t simply walk into Gundabad through the front door; Dagnir will be on you in an instant with her fire-breath. But I can show you the hidden entrance, if you untie me.”\n\nThe hero looked searchingly at Urdug. “I don’t like it,” he said. “How do we know you’re telling the truth?”\n\n“There’s a key.” replied Urdug, “I took it with me when I fled, but I lost it days ago running from an angry giant. Help me find the key, and I will give it to you as proof.”\n\nThe Goblin held out his hands, still bound together, and looked at the heroes pleadingly.\n\n“The Dwarves are known to build secret entrances to their realms, and a key would be convincing proof,” said one of the companions.\n\n“We should wait until we have evidence of his truthfulness before releasing him,” replied the hero with the knife.\n\n“But he insists he would rather die than aid us as our prisoner,” said the first. “We cannot carry him down these mountains, or drag him across Rhovanion, but I believe there are enough of us to keep an eye on him to watch for any sign of betrayal.”\n\n“Very well,” answered the other hero, sheathing his dagger. He narrowed his eyes and looked suspiciously at Urdug while untying him. “We will help you find this key,” he said, “and you will take us to your secret entrance. But be warned: if you attempt any deception, I will slit your throat.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Urdug rising to his feet, “Urdug will find you the key, and maybe the horn I lost as well. Perhaps even my friend, Tiny. I think he escaped when the giant attacked us. He was never too bright, but he knew when fight and when to run. Anyway, off we go. Follow me!”\n\nAnd with that, Urdug led the bewildered heroes down the slopes of the Grey Mountains to retrace his steps through Wilderland.",

But Urdug they kept alive because they still needed the location of the secret entrance to Gundabad. They bound him again with cords, and this time the Goblin did not complain. He didn’t even so much as whimper. Urdug had taken his chance to escape and failed. He knew that if he caused any more trouble for the adventurers that his fate would be the same as Tiny’s.\n\n“We have the key to the Goblin’s door but it is still a long way to Mount Gundabad, and we are ill supplied for such a journey,” said one of the heroes.\n\n“Agreed,” said another. “There is a great settlement of Woodmen between us and the mountain. It rests on the edge of Mirkwood Forest. Hrogar’s Hill, they call it. People are friendly there – though perhaps not to Goblins.”\n\nHe threw Urdug a sharp glance, but the Goblin did not even raise his eyes to see.\n\n“Excellent,” replied the other hero. “Then we head for Hrogar’s Hill.”\n\nThe heroes packed their things and began the long trek to the Woodmen settlement, leading their captive by a rope tied to his wrists.",

        "flavorIntro": "Hrogar’s Hill was a Woodmen settlement with a tall, wooden palisade that encircled it. The wall was built upon an earthen rampart and surrounded by a deep moat. A single, wooden draw-bridge connected the town to the road that led to its gate. Watch-towers were built on either side of the gate and guards kept their vigil there day and night.\n\nAt the far end of town opposite the gate, was the hill from which the settlement took it’s name: a tall, steep slope ascended by a fortified stair, and upon its summit was built Hrogar’s Hall. The Woodmen gathered there for important meetings and celebrations. If the town were to be overrun, they could take shelter there and long withstand a siege, for the Woodmen always kept supplies stored within.\n\nDuring the day, the Woodmen worked in the pastures and gardens that surrounded the town, or felled trees at the edge of Mirkwood forest nearby. But at night, they withdrew inside their walls and raised the draw-bridge as protection from dangerous forest-dwellers and Goblin raids. So it was that the heroes found the entrance barred when they arrived a few hours past sunfall on a dark night.\n\n“Who goes there?” called a guard from one of the watch-towers.\n\n“Travelers on an errand from King Brand in Dale,” answered one of the heroes. “We seek food and shelter for the night, and we have gold to trade for supplies.”\n\n“That is good,” replied the guard. “The servants of King Brand are welcome in our town, though it is long since any have visited. But what is that you bring with you?” He pointed to the Goblin whose wrists that had bound with rope.\n\n“This is our captive,” answered the hero pulling Urdug into the light with a tug of his rope.\n\n“The Master will not like that,” said the guard. “We have had many battles with the Goblins, but we are not accustomed to taking prisoners. For what purpose do you bring him here?”\n\n“That should not be answered in the open. Let us in, and we can speak more plainly.” said the hero.\n\n“Very well,” replied the guard, “I will summon the Master. Wait there.”\n\nAfter a little while, the draw-bridge was lowered and a small troop of armed guards ushered the companions through the gate where they were greeted by the Master; a big man with a bushy, white beard and keen eyes. He regarded the heroes with a friendly smile and said, “Welcome friends! What brings you to Hrogar’s Hill?”\n\n“We are on an urgent errand to Mount Gundabad with this Goblin as our guide,” answered one of the heroes.\n\n“Strange tidings!” exclaimed the Master. “Gundabad is a name of ill omen, and to follow a Goblin there seems folly. Your errand must be urgent indeed to travel there in such a manner. Tell me friends, what need drives you thither?”\n\n“We hunt a great Dragon: Dagnir the Terrible. This Goblin claims she drove his people from their homes in Mount Gundabad,” answered the hero.\n\n“A Dragon?” laughed the Master, appearing relieved. “My friends, this Goblin has deceived you. There has not been a Dragon seen in this part of the world since time out of legend.”\n\n“Deceived we may be,” answered the hero, “but the Dragon we seek is real. Two of its spawn we have killed already, and we fear what their mother may do when she learns what has befallen her children.”\n\n“Two Dragons?” said the Master with a fresh regard for his guests. His eyes were wide with wonder. Then, he collected himself and said, “I must hear the tale of these deeds. Come, you will be guests at my table tonight and tell me your story. My guards will keep watch over your prisoner.”\n\nTwo Woodmen escorted a sullen Urdug away as the Master led the adventurers up the steep hill to Hrogar’s Hall. There the heroes were seated at a long table and food was brought to them. The Master sat at the head of the table and listened to all they had to tell until their meal was suddenly cut short by the sound of alarm from outside.\n\nThe heroes followed the Master out of the hall where they saw in the distance a terrifying red-orange glow that cut a swath through the black night as it moved toward the town below. Dagnir had come.",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "As the first cold light of dawn climbed over Hrogar’s Hill, it revealed the smoldering remains of the Woodmen town. The city gate was smashed, and the watch-towers on either side were burnt to the ground. Inside the blackened walls, houses were still burning or already collapsed into scorched ruins. Yet atop the steep hill, Hrogar’s Hall still stood. The women and children had taken refuge inside during the attack, and a large part of the people survived thanks to the gallantry of the defenders.\n\nThe heroes had driven back the Dragon, but only after she had grown tired of hundreds of stinging arrows and sword strokes. No weapon had been able to pierce Dagnir’s thick armor enough to do her any real harm. When she reatreated into the night, it was only because she had grown tired of smashing homes, and her fires burned low.\n\nThe companions were not surprised when the Master emerged from Hrogar’s Hall and asked them to leave at once. Even if he knew better, many of his people accused the heroes of bringing the Dragon to their town. Some noted that there were Goblins who joined Dagnir in her attack and suspected that they were trying to rescue Urdug.\n\nAs it happened, their captive was nowhere to be found. At first they suspected that his guards left him to fight the Dragon. That was until they found their bodies in an alley. One had a dagger in his back, and the other a slash across his throat. Without their Goblin guide and without the means to defeat Dagnir, the heroes had to rethink their plan. Here the Master provided them with a parting gift, a bit of lore to help them on their journey.\n\n“Until last night I thought Dragons were merely legend, but now that I know they are not, I am reminded of another story: the tale of a mighty warrior who slew the great worm, Scatha. It was rumored that he wielded an enchanted blade powerful enough to pierce the Dragon’s hide, and it was afterwards called ‘Wormsbane.’”\n\n“Such a weapon would surely aid us in our quest. Tell us: where can we find it?” asked one of the companions.\n\n“That’s easy,” answered the Master. “The man who wielded the sword was named Fram, and he won such great renown that his people named their city after him. Search for his resting place in Framsburg.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Thousands of years ago, Scatha the Worm attacked the Dwarves of Ered Mithrin and amassed a great hoard from their treasuries. He was one of the greatest Dragons in the Third Age of Middle-earth and the scourge of Wilderland, but even more renowned was Fram son of Frumgar, for he it was that slew the worm with his sword and claimed its treasure for his own.\n\nFram was lord of the Eotheod, and he used his wealth to improve the capital city of his people, which they afterward named Framsburg in his honor. It was rumored that the Dwarves demanded Fram return the treasure Scatha stole from them, but he refused. Instead, he made a necklace from the Dragon’s teeth and gave it to them with these words: “Jewels such as these you will not find in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by.” It is said that the Dwarves were so angered by this rebuke that they slew Fram in revenge.\n\nIn the years that followed, Eorl the Young would come to lead the Éothéod and bring them south to Rohan, whereafter they were known as the Rohirrim. Their old capital of Framsburg was abandoned and fell into ruin, and the tomb of their hero, Fram, lay hidden for millennia.\n\nIt was in Fram’s tomb that the heroes now hoped to find his legendary sword, Wormsbane. After their battle with Dagnir at Hrogar’s Hill, the adventurers learned their weapons were not sufficient to kill the Dragon. They hoped that the enchanted blade of Fram would be able to slay the beast. So they had traveled west from Hrogar’s Hill until they reached the river Anduin, then they followed the river north to Framsburg.\n\nThe ruins of the old city lay at the meeting of the Greylin and Langwell rivers. The Greylin ran down from the Grey Mountains to the north, and the Langwell flowed from the Misty Mountains to the west. When they joined, they formed the headwaters for the mighty Anduin that flowed far south where it served as a wide barrier between Gondor and Mordor, but here in the north the heroes were able to ford the river without too much trouble.\n\nOnce across, the adventurers made straight for the old keep. Age had taken its splendor and given it a haunted look, and in the failing light of the setting sun, the keep stood above the decayed remains of the dead city like a dark sentry, foreboding an evil fate for any who disturbed the memories of those long past. For a moment it seemed to the heroes that a faint blue light could be seen from a high window, but when they looked again the window was a black hole.\n\nA hush fell on the company as they walked along the ancient road that led to the keep. They neither saw nor heard any sign of danger, yet their hands rested anxiously on their weapons as a feeling of dread grew with each step they took towards the dark hold. They walked in silence, their eyes darting this way and that as if expecting some sudden assault, until at last they reached the gate. Its empty archway stood open like the black mouth of some horrible beast, but they could see nothing inside.\n\nThey lingered there for a moment until one of the companions spoke: “I like not this place. There is some evil afoot here.”\n\n“I feel it too,” said another, “Yet the sword we seek lies within.”\n\n“I fear what else we will find,” answered the first.\n\n“As do I. Let’s find out together,” came the reply. “Come. Follow me.”\n\nTogether the heroes entered in the dark keep in search of Fram’s tomb.",

        "doNotRead": "Beneath the haunted keep of Framsburg, in the dark of Fram’s tomb, the heroes were confronted by the shade of Fram himself. He regarded the heroes with lifeless eyes and the walls shook when he spoke: “Why do you come here? Have you come to steal my treasure? You cannot have it!”\n\nSuch power and terror was in his voice that the heroes staggered and could not at first respond. The dead man howled with rage, and again the cave trembled. It seemed that he would attack when one of the companions managed to speak: “Wait! We don’t want your treasure! It is a sword we seek. Wilderland is again threatened by a mighty Dragon, and we need your sword to defeat it.”\n\n“Lies!” shouted Fram. “You want the gold from Scatha’s hoard, but I won’t let you take it!”\n\n“No my lord!” answered the hero. “There is no treasure left in Framsburg. It has been abandoned for millennia.”\n\n“What? What trickery is this?” asked the shade, its voice losing some of its terror. “Where is my gold?”\n\n“I know not,” replied the hero. “We found naught but this as we explored the keep,” he said holding up the Dragon-tooth necklace.\n\n“Ahh!” cried the shade as if pained by the sight. “The necklace! I remember!” His lifeless eyes were fixed on the necklace as he spoke: “When the Dwarves heard Scatha was dead, they sent emissaries to demand their gold be returned, but they were haughty and I disliked their manner, so I gave them the necklace and naught else. With mocking words I threw it at their feet, thinking little of their wrath.”\n\n“Then it was your pride that doomed you to this fate,” spoke the hero.\n\nThe shade seemed to contemplate this before it continued to speak: “Pride? Perhaps so. I thought that I had nothing to fear from the Dwarves. I had just slain the great worm, and they were guests in my house. But I underestimated the fire that burned within them. I thought them only a stunted people, but they set upon my guards in the night and slew me in my own keep.”\n\n“It was an evil death, my lord,” the hero said, “but it would seem that you brought this curse on yourself by provoking them.”\n\nFram’s ghost appeared to diminish further with its reply, “You are right; it was pride and greed that doomed me to this fate. I will bear it no longer.”\n\nFram lifted his eyes from the necklace to regard the heroes, and as they looked back at him they no longer saw a powerful shade, but instead it seemed to them that an old, wizened man stood before them.\n\n“You may have my sword. It lies within,” he said, pointing to the sarcophagus at the center of the tomb. “I repent of my arrogance. Forgive me.”\n\nWith those words, the shade of Fram closed his eyes and a peace washed over his face before he disappeared. The companions stood silently for a moment before opening his sarcophagus. Inside was the dusty skeleton of the fifth lord of the Éothéod. Chain mail hang from rotted bones, a crown rested atop its skull, and across its chest laid Wormsbane - broken in two pieces.”",

        "flavorIntro": "As morning dawned on the ruins of Framsburg, the heroes had already left the broken streets and buildings behind them on their way north. They paused atop a high hill to take one last look at the forgotten city, and it seemed to them that in the gentle light of the rising sun the old keep no longer held any menace.\n\n“Farewell, Fram son of Frumgar,” spoke one of the heroes.\n\n“May his spirit finally rest in peace,” another intoned.\n\n“I would rest easier if we weren’t on our way to confront a giant Dragon with a broken sword,” one of their companions complained. “I can’t believe we went through all that trouble for a splintered blade!”\n\n“It was a disappointment to us all,” said one, “but we must I find a way nonetheless.”\n\n“Find a way?” came the reply.“How are we going to fight Dagnir the Terrible with a broken sword? Throw it at her?”\n\n“We reforge it,” answered the first, ignoring the jab. “Legend holds that Durin, father of Dwarves, awoke to this world in Mount Gundabad. According to his people, Durin built his first forge within the mountain and there taught his children the craft of metal work. So we bring the shards of Wormsbane and find the First Forge.”\n\n“This just gets better and better,” laughed the second. “First we find a broken sword, then we carry it into Dagnir’s lair to fix it, while she what — waits politely for us to reforge it? What if she finds us before we’re done? Let’s not forget about the Goblins in her service that still ive in the mines!”\n\n“These are the hazards in our path,” agreed the first, “and we will risk all of them to save Wilderland from Dagnir’s wrath.”\n\nShe looked at her disgruntled friend with compassion, but she spoke with determination: “You saw what she did to the Woodmen’s town at Hrogar’s Hill, and you know how much worse it might have been if we had not been there. We must endure whatever dangers lie in our path to prevent more suffering. We have the skill to repair Wormsbane and the courage to wield it. All that is left is to find Durin’s forge. Are you with me?”\n\n“Aye, of course I’m coming with you. That’s why I dislike this plan so much!” laughed her companion. “Let’s not forget we still have to find Urdug’s secret entrance,” he added.\n\n“I have not forgotten. Indeed, I believe I know where to look for it,” she answered, smiling at her friend. “You remember the Goblin’s account of how he escaped the Dragon? He used his secret route to escape Dagnir’s assault, and fled into the daylight—toward the rising sun. That means the hidden door is on the eastern face of the mountain. The door may be camouflaged but the path leading to it is not. No doubt Urdug and his Goblins left a trail in their hurry to escape.”\n\n“Very well,” replied her friend, “then there is naught else for us to do but get on with this folly. Let us hurry before I regain my senses.”\n\nWith that the heroes resumed their march to Mount Gundabad.",
        "ruling": "**Creating the Quest Deck**\n\nThis scenario uses multiple stage 2 quest cards. When setup instructs players to “Prepare the quest deck,” players must shuffle all stage 2 quest cards together randomly, with side 2A face-up, and place them beneath stage 1. These shuffled stage 2 quest cards are considered to be the “quest deck”.\n\nPlayers will progress through stage 2 quest cards until they have won the game; there is no stage 3. Quest cards are not flipped to side B immediately when revealed. Rather, the current quest card is revealed only at the beginning of the quest phase. Flipping the quest card this way causes  the B side to be revealed.\n\n**Bypassing a Quest Card**\n\nPlayers are given the option to bypass some of the quest cards at the end of the combat phase. Bypassing the current quest removes all progress tokens on it, and moves it to the bottom of the quest deck with side 2B face down. Bypassing a quest is optional, and players may choose to stay on each quest card instead of bypassing it. When a quest stage is bypassed (or defeated), it causes the next stage 2A to be revealed, triggering its ’when revealed’ effect.\n\n**When a quest is completed, players will either add it to their victory display or win the game**.\n\n**The Caves Deck**\n\nTo create the Caves deck, take each card from the Lost Caves encounter set and shuffle them together. This is the Caves deck.",
        "doNotRead": "The blade of From son of Frumgar bit deep into Dagnir’s chest and the Dragon bellowed in pain. Her roars shook the walls of the great hall, and her mighty tail smashed against a tall pillar, toppling it. As she thrashed about in her death throes, Wormsbane was wrested from the hero who dealt the final blow. Then, the giant Dragon toppled over the edge of a deep chasm and disappeared into utter darkness.\n\nDagnir the Terrible was dead and Wormsbane lost to the world forever, but all about the heroes lay the glittering treasure of Gundabad. Piles of gold were scattered here and there by the Dragon’s death spasms, and now the entire hall was lit by the sparkling reflection of torch-light on shimmering jewels. Such a wealth had not been imagined since Erebor was recovered from Smaug the Golden.\n\nThe companions clapped each other on their backs and started rummaging through the treasure. One of them opened his travel pack and was stuffing as much gold as he could fit inside when his companions laid a gentle hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Easy friend,” spoke his companion. “Others need this gold more than we.”\n\n“But surely there is enough here for us as well?” complained the adventurer with a pack full of gold.\n\n“Indeed,” answered his companion with a smile, “but let us learn from Fram’s example and not be greedy.”\n\nThe adventurer looked at the gold spilling out of his pack and sighed, “Aye. You’re right. The people of Hrogar’s Hill will need this wealth to rebuild their town.”\n\nHe stood and emptied the gold from his bag, when from outside they heard a horn blast. The heroes stopped what they were doing and listened. Another horn blast rang out.\n\n“I know that horn,” said one of the heroes in a grim voice. “Urdug,” said another.\n\nThey drew their weapons and rushed to the gate. A full moon was overhead, and below them they saw Urdug astride a mighty Warg blowing his horn. About him was a large force of Goblins making their way up the mountainside. Mount Gundabad was under siege.",

        "flavorIntro": "Urdug had been busy since escaping his captors at Hrogar’s Hill. He had gathered the scattered host of Gundabad and led them back to the mountain, but it had taken some doing.\n\nWhen Dagnir attacked the Woodmen’s town, it provided the Goblin chieftain with the perfect opportunity to slip his bonds and disappear. Killing his guards was just an added pleasure. He had endured too much humility at the hands of the heroes who forced him to march across Rhovanion on their quest, but the long journey had also given him the time to plot his revenge.\n\n“If these heroes are so determined to slay Dagnir, then why not help them?” he had thought to himself. “And when the Dragon is dead, me and my lads will kill these fools and take back our home.” So he gave them the key to his secret entrance and told them the story of how he escaped through the eastern door when Dagnir first attacked Gundabad.\n\nAfter he slipped the heroes at Hrogar’s Hill, he came upon two of his brethren fleeing the battle. He recognized them as traitors who chose to serve Dagnir after she usurped his place in Gundabad. He set upon them in a fury, killing one and holding the other at knife point. “Listen you maggot!” he snarled, “I ought to slit your throat like I did your traitor friend, but I need you to carry a message back to that den of gutless cowards back home: Dagnir’s days are numbered. A band of mighty warriors is on their way to Gundabad to slay her soon.”\n\n“H-how do you know?” asked his captive.\n\n“Because I’ve sent them, you worm!” snapped Urdug. “I’ve set things in motion to take back what’s mine, and anyone who gets in my way will end up like that.” He pointed to the Goblin corpse at his feet. “So run and tell those miserable lackeys that they better join with me when they hear my war-horn.”\n\nAfter he let his messenger go, he traveled through the Grey Mountains on his way west, searching out the Goblins who fled that way when the Dragon came. By the time he reached Mount Gundabad, he already had a small army with him, but he was careful to stay out of sight until his spies returned with news of Dagnir’s demise.\n\n“Har, har! I told you lads!” he laughter, “Just like I promised: Dagnir is dead and Gundabad is ours!”\n\nAnd with that, he mounted his Warg and blew a loud blast on his war-horn. “Follow me, boys!” he cried as he rode toward Gundabad.\n\nInside the mountain, the heroes heard the sound and raced to see the approaching army. More Goblins were joining them from their hiding-holes; lackeys answering their master’s call.\n\nThere was little time for the heores to organize a defense. They were outnumbered many times over, but among them was no thought of surrender; the Goblins would make cruel sport of any captives. Their only option was to fight. Urdug had the overwhelming force, but the heroes determined he would pay dearly for each life he took. And if the price proved too steep, there was a small hope that the Goblins would be dismayed and scatter. So it was with fierce war cries that Urdug and the heroes charged into battle.",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "The rocks about the gate were stained black with blood, and the slopes of Mount Gundabad were littered with the slain. Unbelievably, the heroes had prevailed in battle against the larger force of Goblins determined to retake the mountain. The battle had not gone well, but the Goblins’ battle lust wavered in the face of the heroes’ fierce defense. The companions fought like cornered beasts, thoughtless of their peril, almost savage in their desperation. The Goblins had never seen warriors like these, and it was only Urdug’s will that drove them on. When their chieftain was pulled down from his Warg and slain, the Goblins’ will broke and they scattered in fear.\n\n“The day is ours!” shouted one of the heroes, and his companions cheered. They withdrew inside the gate and each slumped to the ground with exhaustion. The wealth of Gundabad lay before them, but any one of them would have traded it all for a cup of water and something to eat.\n\nIt had been a long road from the Iron Hills to Mount Gundabad, but Dagnir was dead and the Goblins were scattered. All that was left was to divide the treasure. Messengers were sent east to the Woodmen at Hrogar’s Hill, and from there further east to King Brand in Dale. Within a fortnight, the first troop of Woodmen arrived to help the heroes liberate the wealth of Gundabad.\n\nThe greater share of the treasure was given to the Master at Hrogar’s Hill to help rebuild the town. Yet much wealth was carried back to Dale with the heroes for their triumphant return. It was upon a fair spring day the heroes arrived in King Brand’s hall with an escort of the king’s men and several large chests of gold.\n\nKing Brand stood and greeted the heroes, “Well met once again, my friends. All Wilderland sings of your deeds. Honored shall you ever be among my people. Come, sit at my table and enjoy the celebration.”\n\nThe heroes bowed, and one spoke, “Thank you, my lord. You give us great honor, but there is one thing that remains unsettled in Rhovanion.”\n\n“Yes, indeed,” said Brand, “Your friends, the Haradrim.”\n\nHe lifted his cup and spoke, “I swear to you, by this time next year they will be safely settled within my realm as honored friends.”\n\nThe hero bowed again and said, “Twice thanks, my lord. Then all is settled and we are content.”\n\n“All except for the growling of my stomach,” laughed another of the companions. “It is hard to endure the courtesies of court after a long journey when the smell of food fills my nose.”\n\nThe king laughed and said, “Well said! Please, sit and eat. This meal is in your honor. And when you have eaten your fill, I will hear the whole account of your adventures.”\n\nThe heroes enjoyed the greatest meal of their lives, sweetened with the success of their quest. They regaled the king’s court with the details of their journey: the Withered Heath, the cold-drake, Urdug, Dagnir’s attack on Hrogar’s Hill, the ghost of Fram, Wormsbane, the Dragon’s death, and the battle of Mount Gundabad.\n\n“My friends,” said King Brand, “You have journeyed far and done much. Wilderland is in your debt. These deeds of yours will live forever in the songs of Dale.”\n\nThen, to the lasting delight of the heroes, a minstrel was called forth to sing their tale. As they listened to the bard’s account of their deeds, they wondered at all they had accomplished.",

        "flavorIntro": "It was late spring and the trees were already blossoming in Dale when envoys from Dorwinion arrived with an urgent message for King Brand. The city guard escorted the weary travelers to the great keep where they found the King holding court from upon his wooden throne. Citizens of Dale and nearby Lake-town were gathered there seeking audience, and a motley band of adventurers stood to one side observing what was said. The guards made their way through the crowd and brought the Dorwinions straight to the foot of Brands throne.\n\n“Welcome friends,” said King Brand to the weary Dorwinions. “What brings you here in such haste?”\n\nThe Dorwinions bowed, and one of them said, “A great darkness has befallen our fair country, my lord.”\n\n“People are missing,” said another. “Whole vineyards go untended in the countryside because the workers have disappeared. We fear what these things forebode, but we are helpless to forestall it; we have no warriors to protect us.”\n\n“Alas, that I have none to send thee,” the King spoke sadly. “My country was this last winter beset by Orcs and Dragons, and we recover still. I’m afraid all my warriors are needed here.”\n\n“Have you no one you can spare, my lord?” asked one of the Dorwinions.\n\n“Indeed not,” was King Brand’s grave reply. “Though I wish that it were otherwise.”\n\n“Then I fear that Dorwinion will be consumed by darkness,” lamented one of the messengers.\n\n“Perhaps not,” spoke one of the adventurers who stood nearby. He motioned to his companions. “My friends and I have rested here long enough and we stand ready to aid your people.”\n\nWalking forward to the foot of the throne, he knelt and continued: “We have enjoyed King Brand’s hospitality, and by his leave we will journey to Dorwinion to confront the growing shadow there.”\n\nThe Dorwinions regarded the adventurer with surprise, but the King smiled and spoke. “My friend, this country owes you and your friends a debt that cannot be repaid. I could not ask you to undertake another journey into danger on my behalf. But since you do now volunteer, I am glad. I can think of no one better suited for this task. Go with my blessing and the goodwill of my peopled.”\n\nThe King ordered that a boat be provisioned for the long journey to Dorwinion, and an oarsman familiar with the southern passage of the River Running be assigned to bring the heroes there safely.\n\nOnce underway, the heroes learned much from the oarsman assigned to them by King Brand. His was named Rutland, and he was a seasoned boatman who made his livelihood ferrying goods up and down the River Running. He told the heroes all he knew of Dorwinion and its surrounds as the current brought them ever closer.\n\n“They’re a peaceful people - not much for fighting,” said Rutland. “They prefer making that famous wine of theirs. Its powerful stuff, too. The Elves in Mirkwood can’t get enough of it. Last year I made enough gold from trading with them to buy this here boat.” He smiled proudly and patted the oar he was using to steer.\n\n“Yep,” he continued. “We deal with all kinds: Dorwinions, Elves, Easterlings, and now them Haradrim you brought this spring.”\n\n“What dealings do you have with Easterlings?” asked one of the heroes.\n\n“Just a little trade,” said the oarsman. “Some of their merchants set up camp just north of Dorwinion on the eastern shore of the river. We like to stop there on our way to and from the Sea of Rhûn to swap goods and news. They’re honest people, even if they seem strange to us.”\n\n“That is surprising news,” said the hero with wonder. “We thought all Easterlings were our enemies and hated the West.”\n\n“I wouldn’t be too quick to guess what all Easterlings think of the West or anything else,” chuckled Rutland. “They come in all different kinds, just like you and me. I expect most of them would rather live with their neighbors than kill them, though sure enough there are some who want blood. But they spend a fair bit of time fighting amongst themselves from what I hear. Matter of fact, the merchants we trade with on the river mentioned once how they were threatened themselves. Seems some cadre of warriors didn’t approve of them doing business with us.”\n\n“I should like to meet these merchantsd said the hero. I have never spoken with an Easterling before.”\n\n“You’ll get your chance soon enough,” said Rutland.“We camp there tonight.”\n\nThat evening, just before dusk, the oarsman landed their boat on the eastern shore and led them to the merchants camp. The Easterlings there greeted the Lakeman like an old friend, and they welcomed the adventurers to join them by their fire. As the sun went down, news and drinks passed freely between them, and before long there was merry laughter too. The heroes were enjoying the hospitality of their hosts when there was a terrible cry, and out of the night charged Easterling warriors brandishing torches. They set fire to the huts and threw their torches in Rutland’s boat. The oarsman cried out in terror and was struck down alongside his merchant friend. There was no time to organize a defense and the heroes had no choice but to flee, so they lifted their injured friend and carried him away into the dark night.",

        "doNotRead": "The heroes scrambled up the steep embankment on the western shore of the River Running. Their feet slipped on the loose rocks and their tired legs screamed with pain, yet they toiled on, determined to reach the summit and escape from the valley below. When they reached the top, a wide plain opened before them, and they collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nAfter they caught their breath, the heroes crawled back to the edge of the ravine and looked over the river they had just crossed. Below, upon the eastern shore they saw the Easterling warriors who had pursued them. They appeared to be debating with each other. Some pointed across the river in the direction the heroes had fled while others shook their heads and raised their fists. For a tense moment the heroes feared that these fierce warriors would ford the river and continue the chase, but to their great wonder, the Easterlings instead turned their horses east and rode away.\n\n“Why do they leave?” asked one of the heroes in disbelief.\n\n“Can’t say,” answered Rutland in a pained voice. He coughed and clutched his side.\n\n“Your wound needs attention,” said the hero, looking at the injured Lakeman with concern.\n\n“Aye,” groaned Rutland. “I’ve a friend in the city of Dorwinion who can patch me up. Name’s Niena. Her husband, Torwald, is a cousin of mine. If you can help me there, they’ll take care of me.”\n\n“Of course,” said the hero, helping Rutland to his feet. “Our quest is to answer Dorwinion’s call for help. We should not rest again until we reach the city.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Built upon the shore of the Sea of Rhûn, the capital of Dorwinion was at most times a cacaphony of trade: The docks were lined with boats from Lake-town, hired hands loaded and unloaded cargo, and mules brayed loudly as they pulled heavy carts to and fro. Shouting could also be heard from the merchant district as sellers peddled their wares to the crowds of people who passed between their stands.\n\nBut not this day. When the heroes had arrived in Dorwinion, they found the capital a much quieter place. A shadow of fear hung over the city. People spoke in hushed tones, if they spoke at all. Most of the Dorwinions they met on the street did not greet them but rather looked down and walked faster. Nearly every home and shop around them was shut tight with windows shuttered.\n\nRutland guided them to the home of his cousin, and there a woman motioned for them to come inside. After the heroes entered her home, she glanced outside before closing the door.\n\n“Rutland!” she exclaimed and hugged the Lakeman. When she saw that her embrace pained him, she looked him over with concern, and asked, “What happened to you?”\n\n“I was injured by Easterling raiders when they attacked the merchant camp,” answered Rutland. “These brave companions rescued me.” He motioned to the heroes.\n\nTheir host bowed and said, “Welcome. I am Niena.”\n\n“What troubles this place, Niena?” asked one of the heroes.\n\n“A hidden evil afflicts our city,” she answered softly. “Each night people disappear, but no one will speak of it. Those who did have gone missing themselves. Now everyone looks suspiciously at their neighbors. We are prisoners to our fear.”\n\n“Do you know who might be responsible?” asked the hero.\n\nNiena looked nervously at the door. “There are rumors,” she said. “Some say a cult has taken root here in secret, and they are behind the abductions.”\n\n“Can you tell us more about this cult?” the hero asked. “Who are they? Where do they meet?”\n\n“I know not,” answered Niena. “It is only a rumor. Nobody will speak of it openly, so nothing is known. Please, help my city!” My husband, Torwald, was one of those who tried uncover the truth, and he has been gone for weeks now. I fear that he is dead, but I need to know. Will you not help?”\n\n“We will,” declared the hero. He stood and walked toward the door. Then turning he said, “We will discover the truth behind these disapperances, and unmask this cult if they are responsible. And if we cannot find your husband, then we shall avenge him.”",

She stood over the body of her fallen enemy - the leader of the cult responsible for abducting Dorwinions and nearly subduing the country through fear.\n\n“Yet treachery has ever been the Enemy’s favorite weapon, and greed and corruption his best allies,” replied her companion.\n\n“I know it has always been thus,” she concented. “But it does not lessen the sting of betrayal.”\n\n“That is true,” her friend agreed. “Yet my immediate concern is given to the missing Dorwinions: Where are they? We have searched out every secret meeting place in this city and still not found them.”\n\n“You there!” said the hero, pointing at an injured cultist with her sword. “Where have you taken them? Speak quickly!”\n\nThe cultist clutched his wounded arm and looked wide-eyed at the bloodied sword mere inches from his face. “I - I don’t know!” he stammered.\n\n“You lie!” shouted the hero. The cultist saw a raging fire in her eyes and tried to squirm away from her sword, but the wall was behind him and there was nowhere to go. He raised his good hand and said, “I don’t know where it is.”\n\n“Where what is?”\n\n“The temple!” said the cultist. “The temple where they’ve taken the captives. It’s somewhere in the Hills of Rhûn, but I don’t know where.”\n\n“How did you learn of this temple? Who told you?”\n\n“No one told me. I overheard that one there talking to his boss about it.” The cultist motioned to the dead body at the hero’s feet.\n\n“So, our defeated foe was himself a servant,” remarked the hero’s companion. “Then the real danger is in the Hills of Rhûn, and our work in Dorwinion remains unfinished.”\n\n“Indeed,” agreed the hero as she wiped the blood from her sword. “Let us hand this cultist over to the local authorities and go ourselves in search of this temple.”",

        "flavorIntro": "It took the heroes several days to reach the Hills of Rhûn, and several more before they found a narrow path that wound between the ridges and gorges of the hills. On the path were the unmistakable signs of captives being led upwards, so the heroes followed the trail with redoubled speed and vigil until at last they found what they sought: A mighty temple carved directly into a sheer rockface.\n\nThe entrance to the temple was like the gaping maw of a ravenous beast, and the jagged pillars that flanked either side left no doubt in the heroes’ minds: this was a temple built to Sauron during the dark years of His reign over Middle-earth when the Elves and Númenóreans abandoned the lands east of the Anduin to His rule. Rumors of dark rituals and dreadful sacrifices came to the West out of those years, but never any witnesses. When the Dark Lord was overthrown by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, those who worshipped Sauron fled the wrath of the West, and they hid themselves in dark places where the High-elves and Sea-kings did not go.\n\nBut when the power of Mordor arose once more, those who still worshipped the dark were drawn back to the land of shadow, and there Sauron filled them with terrible malice and vengence against the West. He sent them abroad to lands such as Dorwinion to plant fear and sow dissent in the hearts of those who might oppose Him. They went here and there whispering shade in the ears of the unwise. Some they won to their cause with promises of power; others they subdued with threats of violence. In time, they had won nearly all the lands of Rhûn to their Master’s will.\n\nAll the while, they met in secret to worship their Dark Lord and offer up sacrifices to hasten the day of His wrath. So it was that the heroes found the entrance to the temple guarded. A foul reek issued from it.\n\n“We cannot enter this way undetected,” whispered one hero to another. “If we charge the guards, they will surely alert those inside, and the captives’ lives will be forfeit.”\n\n“Agreed.” said the other. “We must search about for another way in and enter secretly. A temple this size must have more than one opening.”\n\nJust then a horrible scream echoed out from the temple’s black gate.\n\n“We must move quickly, or the Dorwinions will die regardless,” urged the first hero. “See how the sky darkens above? Evil things take place within.”\n\n“It is the work of Mordor,” agreed the second. “Come, we must search for another entrance.”\n\nThey withdrew from the main gate and climbed down the side of the hill that sloped out of the guards’ view. There they found a low cave that led to a deeper tunnel. They lit torches and followed the tunnel as it wound its way beneath the temple of Sauron.",

        "doNotRead": "The heroes fought their way past sewage Easterling warriors to reach the stone altar just in time to stop a dark figure from plunging his dagger into the heart of a helpless Dorwinion man. The man with the dagger recoiled and hissed at the heroes, “Curse you! Not again!”\n\nHis face was scarred and twisted into a hideous fit of rage. The heroes froze when they saw it clearly for the first time.\n\n“Alcaron!”\n\nThe man laughed, and the noise of it was mocking and cruel. “Yes, I was Alcaron,” he said, “until you left me for dead in the Morgul Vale. I should have died, but the Nazgûl would not let me. By their craft, I have been restored. No longer do I hide behind the mantle of Alcaron. You face Ulchor, Thane of Nurn and servant of Sauron. I will have my vengeance upon you!”\n\nUlchor raised his hand as if to strike, but instead there was a rush of wind and every torch in the room blew out. Smoke and darkness consumed the temple chamber. The heroes circled with their backs to one another in order to ward off any attack, but no blow was struck.\n\nAfter a few tense moments, one of the heroes spoke: “He has fled.”\n\n“Shall we give chase?” asked another.\n\n“No,” replied the first. “The Dorwinions here need our help. We must see to their safe return before we give thought to Thane Ulchor.”\n\n“Very well,” he replied. “Let us start with this poor fellow on the altar. Can someone light a torch?”\n\nSeveral torches were lit. The heroes gathered together all the survivors and led them out of the hideous temple. The man they rescued from the altar turned out to be none other than Niena’s husband, Torwald. When he heard that his wife was safe and anxiously awaiting his return, he wept and thanked the heroes many times.\n\nThere were more joyful tears and heartfelt thanks when the heroes arrived in Dorwinion a week later with their rescued captives. Doors and windows were flung open, and the people rushed out to be reunited with their loved ones. As husbands, wives, parents and children embraced again for the first time in months, the dark clouds over Dorwinion were dispersed and the sun shone clear again. But in the hearts of the heroes there lingered a shadow of doom: Ulchor had escaped after swearing vengeance upon them, and he had displayed new powers of sorcery in the temple. He was too dangerous to be allowed to roam freely. The heroes would have to seek him out in order to finish the job they started years ago.",

A light breeze tickled the leaves on the trees, and sunlight danced on the waves that rolled in from the Sea of Rhûn as the heroes strolled through the land that they had rescued from darkness.\n\nIt had been a month since the heroes returned to Dorwinion with the captives they had rescued from the Temple of Sauron. They had not planned to stay for so long, but the people of Dorwinion insisted that the heroes rest and enjoy their hospitality after doing so much for their country. They stayed in the home of Niena and her husband, Torwald, whose life they had saved in that hideous temple.\n\nThe heroes insisted that they should pay their hosts for their lodging, but Niena would hear none of it. “My husband would have died if not for you,” she said. “It is the same for every family in the city, so it is our honor to have you here.” The heroes relented and expressed their thanks for her generosity.\n\nIn their hearts, the companions were glad that they were able to bring peace to Dorwinon after her people had endured such hardship, but in their thoughts there lingered still a shadow that disturbed their peace: Ulchor. Deadly servant of Sauron and the one responsible for the recent suffering of Dorwinion, whom the heroes thought died at their hands several years ago. At that time, they knew him as Lord Alcaron, a Gondorian nobleman. But he was revealed to be a Black Númenórean and a traitor, whose machinations nearly led to their deaths in the Morgul Vale.\n\nIt was believed that Lord Alcaron had died in that evil place; the heroes had just defeated him when he revealed his true name and allegiance to Mordor.\n\nThey were shocked to discover him in the Temple of Sauron, alive and empowered. Ulchor had used their momentary confusion to make his escape, and had promised dark vengeance upon them. This, the heroes knew, was not idle talk, so they had resolved to pursue him when they were rested.\n\n“Then it is agreed,” spoke one of the heroes. “Tomorrow we begin the hunt for Thane Ulchor.”\n\n“Aye,” said another. “I fear we have already waited overlong to begin the chase, but I doubt not that we will find him in time.”\n\n“Very well. Then let us enjoy the hospitality of Dorwinion one more night before setting out in the morning.”\n\nThe heroes were soon comfortably asleep in the house of Niena, but in the dark of night they were woken by shouts and the frantic ringing of bells. From outside the house, they heard the ring of steel and the sound of fighting in the streets. They rushed outside to find an army of Easterlings invading the city, and at its head was a familiar man. Ulchor had come to them.",
        "ruling": "**Controlling Locations**\n\n*Wrath and Ruin* is a battle to liberate the capital of Dorwinion from the forces of Mordor. To represent Dorwinion’s struggle to drive the enemy from every last corner of the ruined city, the players are instructed to take control of locations when they leave play.\n\nStage 1B and 2B both read: “**Forced**: When a location leaves play as an explored location, the first player takes control of it.” To take control of a location, the first player removes all progress from the just explored location and places it in front of him in his play area instead of discarding it. Locations under any player’s control are still in play. Their game text is active and they can be affected by card effects.\n\n**Losing Control of a Location**\n\nThere are many encounter card effects that force players to return locations they control to the staging area. Additionally, some locations have triggered effects that will cause players to return them to the staging area.\n\nWhen a player returns a location he controls to the staging area, he loses control of that location and removes all progress from it. If a player is eliminated from the game, each location controlled by that player is returned to the staging area.",
        "doNotRead": "As the sun rose over the city of Dorwinion the next morning, black smoke rose to meet it. Many hands still struggled to put out fires, while others tended to the wounded. The weary heroes rested near the burned out ruins of Niena’s house. They had returned too late to save her and Torwald from the invading Easterlings.\n\nIt had been a devastating battle. Several of UIchor’s spies still hiding in Dorwinions had slain the city guards and opened the gate to let his army inside the walls. It wasn’t until after the city was nearly overrun that the heroes knew they were under attack. Against all odds, they were able to rally the Dorwinions and beat back Ulchor’s army, driving them from the city. There was great loss on both sides, and as the rising sun revealed the extent of the devastation, the heroes felt it was a pyrrhic victory at best.\n\nAt first, they sat in silence; either too tired, or too grieved to speak. Many of the people they had saved from the Temple of Sauron now lay dead in the streets, or in the blackened ruins of their homes. The companions sat there brooding about the cruelty of it all until one of them finally spoke:\n\n“Vengeance,” he said. “Vengeance I swear upon Ulchor. Vengeance for the people of Dorwinion. I will not rest until I find him and avenge the people he has slain.”\n\nThe others looked up to see the grim determination on their companion’s face. He rose to his feet and extended his hand, “Are you with me?”\n\nOne by one, they took his hand and rose to their feet, and with oaths they swore vengeance upon Ulchor.\n\n“Oaths ye have sworn,” said their leader. “Let us leave now to fulfill them. Pack quickly! Our enemy flies East toward the city of Ulfast.”",

Just as I thought it would.”\n\n“How did you know that Ulchor would travel East and not South toward Mordor?” asked one of the companions as the tall man mounted his horse.\n\n“That was not an army of Orcs he led into Dorwinion, but Easterlings,” answered the man. “And their armor bore the sigil of Ulfast, their King. I suspect that Ulchor went to Ulfast after we drove him from the Hills of Rhûn and demanded that the King provide him with an army in the name of Mordor.”\n\n“How do you think the King will respond when Ulchor returns with only a remnant of his army?”\n\n“He will be furious, I am sure,” replied the man. “But he dare not rebuke an emissary of the Dark Lord. In the past, the Easterlings worshipped Sauron as The Lord of Middle-earth. You saw evidence of that in the temple they built. Even if they no longer worship him, the Easterlings fear the power of Mordor too much to refuse Ulchor.”\n\n“Then how will we reach Ulchor if he has the King’s support?”\n\n“Ulfast is a big city, somewhat akin to Pelargir. The Easterlings conduct trade with ships sailing down the Sea of Rhûn, so foreigners are not uncommon there. If we sneak in by night, we should be able to blend in and search for Ulchor discretely.”\n\n“Then let us ride straightaway for Ulfast. The blood of Dorwinion yet cries for justice, and I would see it done.”",

While that may not seem like a problem, each quest stage will reduce the City Guard’s engagement cost by 5 for each round you linger there.\n\nThat means it will only take a few rounds for the City Guard’s engagement cost to be reduced to a point where it ends up considered to be engaged with you. When that happens, the City Guard will make attacks against you like any other enemy that is engaged with you. So manage your threat with care and move quickly to avoid being defeated!",
        "doNotRead": "The heroes were disarmed and led to the throne room of King Ulfast. There they saw the king, a strong man with a discerning gaze. About him were his palace guards. Upon his head was a golden crown, and on his lap rested the Sceptre of Ulfast. From his high seat upon the dais, the Easterling king looked down upon them and studied them thoughtfully. Standing next to the King with his hand upon the back of the throne was the Black Númenórean, Ulchor. His guards also stood nearby.\n\nThe Thane of Nurn smiled cruelly at the heroes. They had come to Ulfast to capture him, but had ended up being captured themselves. Just as Ulchor had intended it when he alerted the King to their presence in the city.\n\n“You see, your majesty,” said Ulchor pointing at the companions, “Here is your true enemy. They have violated your law by trespassing in your city, and they have broken your peace by fighting with your city guard. They are thieves and killers. You should deal with them accordingly.”\n\nThe King stroked his beard thoughtfully as he listened to all Ulchor had to say. Then he motioned to the heroes and said, “What have you to say in your defense?”\n\nOne of the heroes stepped forward and answered, “Great King. It is true that we did come to your city uninvited, but we beg you, please: hear our full tale before passing judgment. We did not make the long journey here to do you harm, but to seek justice for those lost in Dorwinion and to rescue Ulfast from the yoke of Mordor.”\n\nUlchor laughed. “Yoke! What yoke? Mordor has ever been a friend and ally to you, King Ulfast,” he said. “Sauron the Great has...”\n\n“Sauron the Deceiver has no friends or allies,” proclaimed the hero, interrupting Ulchor “The Dark Lord seeks dominion over all of Middle-earth, East and West alike. To him we are all but pawns to be used or destroyed as he sees fit. Tell me Great King, would you see more of your soldiers die needlessly fighting his wars?”\n\nThe king pondered these words silently, but Ulchor glowered and said to the king. “My lord, do not let these liars deceive you. Have them taken away.”\n\n“No,” said the king, stroking his beard. “I will hear their tale first.”\n\n“But you cannot listen to them!” urged Ulchor.\n\nThe king looked sharply at him and said, “You do not rule here. I am king of Ulfast, and I will decide what can or cannot he done regarding those under my rule.”\n\nUlchor recoiled, releasing his grip on the throne. His face was twisted with terrible wrath. “You rule only by the will of Sauron,” he hissed. Then, he gave his guards a look and shouted, “As the Dark Lord gives, he can also take away!” Ulchor’s men drew their weapons and attacked the palace guards.\n\nThe throne room erupted into a fierce melee. Ulfast’s guards rushed to the throne to protect their king, but many were cut down by Ulchor’s men. The heroes lifted the weapons of the fallen and joined the fray with shouts of “Dorwinion!” At their coming, Ulchor retreated, and they pursued him into the courtyard. But they were stopped by more of Ulfast’s guards who knew nothing of what had happened inside. The heroes threw down their weapons at spearpoint and watched helplessly as Ulchor and his men galloped away on horseback.\n\nMoments later, they were brought back to the throne room where King Ulfast addressed them once more. “You came to my city seeking vengeance on Ulchor. Now it seems your goal and mine are the same. But I cannot move openly against Mordor. Here, then, is my judgment: For saving my life just now, I will spare yours, so long as you pursue the traitor Ulchor. Bring him to justice, and you shall have the friendship of Ulfast.”\n\nThe heroes bowed low, and thanked the king. Ulfast returned to them their weapons and gear, and also furnished them with fresh horses and supplies. Then, they set out once more in pursuit of Ulchor.",

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes followed Ulchor’s trail from the city of Ulfast south across the expanse of Rhûn. It seemed clear to them that the villain now intended to return to his province of Nurn, in the land of Mordor. The heroes rode hard in the hope that they might overtake him before he reached the Black Land.\n\nAt first their pursuit was aided by good weather and a clear trail, but fortune turned against them when they came upon a camp of Wainriders. These were nomadic band of Easterlings who roamed about Rhûn in great wains. They valued their freedom too much to swear allegiance to Sauron, but they were no friends to the West either. When they saw the heroes approaching on horseback, they mounted their horses and quickly encircled the heroes.\n\nSeeing that escape was impossible, the heroes raised their hands in surrender. They did not wish to fight the Wainriders, especially when they were so badly outnumbered. They were taken as prisoners and brought to the Wainrider camp. There, the heroes were questioned about where they came from and where they were going by the Wainrider’s chieftain. When they told the Wainriders about their quest to capture Thane Ulchor, their captors laughed and said, “Yes, we know that one! He was here just before you. He threatened us by the power of Mordor if we did not let him go, and he promised us gold if we killed any who followed him.”\n\n“Did he give you any gold?” asked one of the heroes.\n\n“No,” laughed the Wainrider chieftain. “Only threats and promises.”\n\n“Such is the way of Mordor, my friend. But it is not our way,”  said the hero. “We will pay you with the gold that we have with us if you will let us be on our way. No idle threats or empty promises.”\n\nThe chieftain laughed again. He leaned forward to tell the hero,  “If we wanted your gold, we could just take it.” Then, he leaned back and motioned to the others around him, “But we are not thieves or murderers. That is not our wav. We are riders and chariot racers! Our way is the wind in our hair and the earth rushing beneath us.” The others around him cheered and whooped until he motioned for them to stop.“Can you drive a chariot?” he asked the hero.\n\nThe hero considered his answer and said, “Yes.”\n\n“Good!” smiled the chieftain. “Then this is what we will do: we will have a chariot race. If you can beat our champion, then you may keep your gold and be on your way. But if our champion wins, we will deliver you to Ulchor.”",
        "ruling": "**The Circuit**\n\nWhen setting up the quest deck for the Challenge of the Wainriders, arrange stages 1, 2, and 3 in a row from left to right. Then, place stages 4, 5, and 6 in a row above from right to left, so that stage 4 is positioned directly above stage 3. The two rows together make “the circuit.” After creating the circuit, flip each quest stage over and place The Challengers objective and The Wainriders objective at stage 1B so that the staging area looks like this:\n\nThe Challengers objective represents the players’ position in the race, and The Wainriders objective represents their opponents’ position. The stage that The Challengers objective is at is considered “the Wainriders’ stage.”\n\nWhen the players defeat a quest stage, they advance The Challengers objective counterclockwise to the next stage of the circuit. The Wainriders objective will also advance around the circuit in a counterclockwise direction. If The Challengers objective has advanced through more quest stages than The Wainriders, then the players are considered to be ahead of The Wainriders. When the players defeat stage 6, they complete the circuit. In order to defeat the scenario, The Challengers objective must complete the circuit twice before The Wainriders objective completes the circuit twice.\n\n**Racing X Tests**\n\nRacing tests represent the heroes’ ability to drive their chariot over difficult and dangerous terrain. Succeeding at these tests will beam the difference between winning and losing the race. Each quest stage has a **Forced** effect that initiates a racing X test when that stage is defeated. When his happens, the first player commits a single character to the test by exhausting it. Then, the first player discards the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the total value of that character’s indicated attribute ([willpower], [attack], or [defense]). Some encounter cards have racing test results printed in their lower-right-hand corners. The results types are **straight**, **turn** and **wild** (the **wild** result counts both as a **straight** and a **turn** result). Each racing test specifies which result and how many of that result the players need to discard in order to pass.",
        "doNotRead": "The chariot race was more like a battle than a sporting event. At first, the heroes were unprepared for the ferocity of the Wainriders’ racing skills, but what they lacked in experience they quickly made up for with daring. They drove harder over each rise and around each turn, until they overtook the Wainrider champion to finish in first place.\n\nAfter they crossed the finish line, the heroes were greeted warmly by the Wainrider camp. “Well done! Well done!” they cheered, and clapped them on their backs. “We didn’t know Westerners could ride like that! We will tell stories of this race for years to come. Well done indeed!”\n\n“Then we are free to go?” asked one of the heroes.\n\n“Yes, yes,” answered the Wainrider chieftain. “You have won your freedom. Go with good hearts.”\n\n“Thank you,” said the hero.\n\n“But,” added the chieftain, “if you still mean to find Ulchor, you will need our help.”\n\n“How is that?” Asked the hero.\n\n“Ulchor has gone back to Mordor,” the Wainrider explained. “You cannot follow him there without being captured again; this time not by the Wainriders but by the Orcs. There is no help for you that way.”\n\n“But we have sworn to deliver justice to Ulchor,” replied the hero. “We cannot turn back now.”\n\n“You misunderstand,” said the Wainrider. “You don’t turn back now. There is a way under the Ash Mountains. We can lead you to the entrance for the gold that you have.”\n\nThe hero studied the Wainrider’s face for a moment, then, offering his hand he said, “Agreed.”\n\nThe Wainrider smiled, took his hand and said, “Good.”\n\nThat night the Wainriders held a feast to honor the heroes and celebrate the race they had won. The next morning, the heroes mounted their horses along with a couple of Wainriders who would guide them to the tunnel entrance.",

        "flavorIntro": "It had been two days since the heroes left the Wainrider camp and headed south toward Mordor. The first day of their journey was spent trading stories with their guides as they followed them across the plains. They learned much about the Wainriders and how they had come to roam the open lands of Rhûn.\n\nThe second day was different. As they drew nearer to the northern fences of Mordor, the ground became hard and the sky above them grew dark. A dreadful stillness was on the land. They rode in silence, looking anxiously about them like hunted beasts that fear an attack. But they saw nothing in that barren waste except the black wall of the Ash Mountains looming ever higher before them.\n\nWhen they reached the foothills of those mountains, they stopped next to a wide, washed-out basin. The Wainriders refused to go any further. The heroes were dismayed by this, but there was nothing they could say that would convince their guides to climb with them.\n\n“How will we find the tunnel entrance without your help?” Asked one of the heroes.\n\n“Follow this river-bed,” answered the Wainriders. “It winds up a narrow ravine. The cave entrance is at the top.” Then, they turned their horses and galloped north as if the host of Mordor were after them.\n\nThe heroes looked at each other doubtfully. They dismounted, shouldered their bags, and began to climb. When they came out of the ravine, midway up the northern face of the Ash Mountains, they found the cave entrance just as the Wainriders described it.\n\n“This must be it,” said one of the companions.\n\n“I don’t like the look of it,” added another, trying to peer into the darkness.\n\n“I don’t like the smell of it, said a third, wrinkling his nose. A foul air wafted out of the cavern entrance.\n\n“This is an evil place, but our quest lies beyond it,” said the first. “Will any of us shrink back now?”\n\nThe others shook their heads.\n\n“Very well. Safeguard your rations. We are unlikely to find any provisions within, and who knows what waits for us on the other side!”\n\nOnce again, the heroes shouldered their packs. Then they lit torches and entered the dark passage beneath the Ered Lithui.",
        "ruling": "**Strategy Tip**\n\nIn this adventure, the heroes are sneaking into Mordor by way of the tunnels of Torech Gorgor - a labyrinthian cave system under the Ash Mountains. There is little chance of finding food or water during the passage, so the heroes must move quickly to reach the other side before their supplies run out.\n\nTo represent the theme of dwindling supplies, the quest stages and encounter deck will discard cards from the top of your player deck. If you have no cards in your deck at the end of the round, your characters starve to death and you’re eliminated from the game.\n\nIn order to avoid that horrible fate, players will need to more judicious than normal when it comes to triggering various card drawing abilities. Think carefully before you use these abilities as each card you take into your hand is one less card in your deck, and one step closer to being eliminated.",
        "doNotRead": "It was late afternoon when the heroes emerged from the dark tunnels of Torech Gorgor on the southern slopes of the Ash Mountains. They squinted and blinked as their eyes grew accustomed to the light. It had been days since they had seen the sun. Indeed. deep within the gloomy bowels of the Ered Lithui, they had doubted if they would ever see the sky again, hut they had soldiered on until at last they found their way into the land of Mordor.\n\nIt was hardly what they expected. Before them lay a wide green land of rolling hills and grassy fields; a far cry from the smoke and ash that they had expected. Each of the heroes had heard stories of The Black Land and the Mountain of Fire, so they expected that all of Mordor would fit that description. Yet, if they had thought about it, Sauron could not feed his soldiers with ash or give them fire to drink - even Orcs need food and water. It was necessary that part of the Enemy’s domain should be fertile for producing those things, and it was here in the province of Nurn that The Dark Lord harvested what he needed to provision his armies.\n\nThis was also the province ruled over by Thane Ulchor. He it was that the heroes had journeyed into this land to find. As their eyes adjusted to the light, the companions began to make their way down the foothills of the Ash Mountains. They moved as quietly and carefully as they could, unwilling to let the scenic landscape lull them into a false sense of safety. They knew that regardless if the land was black or green, this was Mordor. They were in the Enemy’s territory now.",

        "flavorIntro": "After descending from the southern fences of the Ered Lithui, the heroes headed south toward the Sea of Núrnen where they knew they would find Ulchor’s fortress upon the northern shore. They had learned this much from the King of Ulfast, who was eager to have his revenge upon the Thane of Nurn. He told them to follow the river that flowed south from the Ash Mountains, which would lead them to Ulchor’s fortress of Dol Rhugar.\n\nDol Rhugar was the capital city of Nurn. From there Thane Ulchor ruled over that land, but it was not Ulchor who built the city. The fortress was built by the Númenóreans during the Watchful Peace, after The Last Alliance of Elves and Men overthrew Sauron. They built a tower of guard to keep watch over the eastern border of Mordor, and a city grew up around it. Minas Fuin it was called in those days, and those that lived there were not without gladness, for the land of Nurn prospered under Númenórean rule.\n\nBut those days were long passed. When the Númenórean race declined and Sauron again rose to power, those who had worshipped him in secret came forth to declare themselves. Among them were Ulchor’s ancestors, who helped to overthrow the last remnants of the Númenóreans forces in Nurn. As a reward for their fealty, The Dark Lord granted the land of Nurn to Ulchor’s family and bestowed upon them the title of Thane. But in return, Sauron demanded provisions for his armies in the regions of Gorgoroth, where nothing grew.\n\nSo it was that as the heroes drew near to the sea of Núrnen, they encountered the slave-worked fields that surrounded Dol Rhugar, and they saw The Dark Lords prisoners being made to harvest crops and raise livestock to feed his vast armies. There were Elves, Dwarves, and men dressed only in rags and bent with hard labor. Stern Easterlings moved among them and drove them harder still with cruel whips.\n\nThe heroes watched all this from the shelter of a low hill overlooking the fields. There they debated what should be done.\n\n“We must help these people!” declared one, struggling to keep her voice down.\n\n“But what of our quest to find Ulchor?” asked her companion.“If we intervene here, he will surely be alerted to our presence.”\n\n“Aye,” voiced another. “Then how shall we fulfill our oaths of vengeance upon him?”\n\n“We swore an oath to avenge the people of Dorwinion,” answered the first,  “but they are gone, and fulfilling it will not bring them back. These people,” she said, pointing at the fields, “are alive and need our help. We cannot overlook the living to avenge the dead.”\n\nThere was silence as the others contemplated her words. Then, at last, one of her companions spoke. “I began this quest to see Ulchor pay for his crimes; to avenge the deaths of Niena, Torwald, and the rest. But we all know that if Niena could speak to us now, she would tell us not to worry about her when there are others in need.”\n\nThe others looked up at this, and they were surprised to see they were smiling at her memory, and that of her husband Torwald.\n\n“It is agreed then?” asked the first.\n\n“Yes,” said her companion, drawing his weapon. “We will set upon these Easterling slavers and release their captives.”\n\nThe other heroes nodded and did the same. Then, the first raised her sword and cried aloud, “For Niena!” and charged into battle.",

        "doNotRead": "The Easterlings were wholly unprepared for the heroes’ sudden attack; they thought themselves safe from all harm here in the land of Mordor. The heroes used this to their advantage when they launched their assault. Though the Easterlings far outnumbered them, they were used to whipping prisoners and shooting escapees - they could not match the ferocity of the heroes’ attack, or stand before their wrath. Those that didn’t  die dropped their weapons and fled back to Dol Rhugar.\n\nOnce the fighting was done, the prisoners rallied around the heroes, who had unlocked their chains with keys taken from fallen guards. Former slaves rubbed their wrists and ankles as they looked around themselves in disbelief. None of them could have ever imagined that help would reach them all the way in Mordor.\n\n“Thank ye, lads,” said an elderly Dwarf named Farin. Years of captivity had nearly broken his pride, but when the fighting started he was one of the first to lift a weapon and join in. “I never thought I’d get the chance to make these slavers pay.”\n\n“Yes, thank you!” spoke an Elf. His name was Edrahil. “I was captured at Amon Lane and brought here. It has been so long since I have seen the forest that I was nearly lost to despair. Did my lord Thranduil send you? ”\n\n“Nay,” said one of the heroes. “We have come to Mordor seeking vengeance against the Thane of Nurn for his crimes against Dorwinion. We knew nothing of your captivity until we came upon you just now.”\n\n“You are too few to assault the Thane’s stronghold of Dol Rhugar,” said a Gondorian man named Arador. He had fought valiantly alongside the heroes once the battle began.\n\n“We had not planned to lay siege to his fortress when we first pursued Ulchor,” said one of the heroes. “Our plan was to come upon him unlooked for in the land where he felt safest and least expected an attack. But all of that changed when we found you.”\n\n“We are grateful for your intervention,” said Edrahil. “But it will count for naught if Ulchor is not defeated. Otherwise, he will surely gather his army and hunt us down.”\n\n“Aye,” said Farin, “He would not remain Thane of Nurn for long if Sauron learned that he had let his prisoners escape. He’ll come for us, alright.”\n\n”Then we must get you to safety!” Urged one of the heroes, feeling responsible for the fate of these people.\n\n“There is no safety in Mordor,” replied Arador. “There is only one thing we can do: attack Dol Rhugar.”\n\n“What?” said Farm in disbelief. “Are you mad?’”\n\n“No,” answered Arador. “Ulchor will expect us to run. He will not expect us to marshal our forces for an assault.”\n\n“That’s because it is folly,” urged Edrahil. “Even if we all had. weapons and armor, we’d still have no way to breach the walls of Dol Rhugar.”\n\n“But we do,” said Arador. “There are other prisoners within the city; slaves who are made to serve Ulchor and his lieutenants. I used to be one of them until I was sent to the fields for displeasing my master. While I was working in the city, I discovered a secret entrance long forgotten by the people there. I can use it to enter the city at night while you gather your forces nearby. Once inside, I will find others to help me open the gate and signal you to attack. We can be inside the city before the alarm goes up.”\n\nFarin grinned. “I’m beginning to like this plan,” he said.\n\n“But what do we hope to accomplish once inside?” asked Edrahil.\n\nArador motioned to the heroes and replied, “These brave companions showed us what only a few can achieve with surprise and determination on their side.” He looked around at all of the freed captives gathered around them, and said, “Just imagine what all of us together can achieve.”\n\nEdrahil smiled and nodded.\n\nFarin laughed and said, “Then let’s get moving.

        "flavorIntro": "The heroes were huddled behind a low hill less than a mile from the gate of Dol Rhugar. Gathered about them were the prisoners they had rescued from the slave-fields that surrounded the fortress. They were waiting under the cover of night for the signal to attack. The Gondorian, Arador, had come up with a plan to infiltrate the city. He took with him Edrahil the Elf and Farin the Dwarf. The three of them were going to rally the captives inside the city in order to open the gate. A single, long horn blast would be their signal to begin the full attack.\n\nAs the heroes waited for the signal, they reflected on the string of chances that had led them to this moment. “I feel as if some fate has brought us to this place,” said one of the heroes looking at his companions. “How else could we possibly have gathered an army just outside Ulchor’s fortress, deep in Mordor, ready to launch a surprise attack?”\n\n“It is a wondrous turn of events,” replied another hero. “Perhaps it is the Valar who have guided us here?”\n\n“I cannot say what is the will of the Valar, though I welcome their aid,” said another. “What I know is this: Ulchor is a traitor and a murderer. He should have been dealt with years ago in The Morgul Vale, but it seems the evil that is in that land has also the power to restore the flesh.”\n\n“No doubt the process caused him great agony,” murmured another. “The ways of the Dark Lord are never kind, and powerful sorcery comes at a price. Ulchor has indeed grown more powerful, but madness seems to have nearly taken him as a result. How else could he have acted so brashly in the court of King Ulfast? He had but to mask his contempt for a minute, and victory might have been his.”\n\nThe wrath of the Enemy has often been our unwitting ally through the long years agreed one of the companions. “The desire for vengeance has often overruled wiser counsel.”\n\nThere was a short pause as each of the heroes considered their own motives, and then one of them spoke, “After Dorwinion was attacked,  I swore an oath of vengeance to channel my grief and focus my rage. That oath nearly led me to overlook those who are gathered with us now.” He bowed his head with shame.\n\n“We all swore the same oath,” said another, placing her hand on his shoulder. “We are all in this together, but let us now amend our oath to seek justice rather than revenge.”\n\nThe man looked up at her and answered, “Aye, I swear by the Valar that when gate of Dol Rhugar opens, I will bring justice to UIchor or die in the attempt.”\n\nAll the heroes swore likewise. Then there came a change in the wind, and a breeze coming up from the south carrying the salty tang of the sea. Their spirits were lifted by the smell, and their limbs strengthened. They looked up and saw the stars piercing the darkness like bright lances.\n\nThere was another breeze, and this time it carried the sound of a long horn-cry.",
        "ruling": "**The Power of Mordor Deck**\n\nThe Power of Mordor Deck represents Sauron’s expanding influence over Middle-Earth. To build The Power of Mordor deck when setting up *The Fortress of Nurn*, take each card from “The Power of Mordor” encounter set and shuffle them together. This is The Power of Mordor deck.\n\n**Storm the Castle**\n\nWhile setting up *The Fortress of Nurn*, the players are instructed to add all 4 copies of the “Storm the Castle” side quest to the staging area. Each of these side quests is double-sided, with “Storm the Castle” on one side, and a different side quest on the reverse side. These should be randomized before adding them to the staging area so that the players do not know which side quest is on the reverse side.\n\nWhen a copy of Storm the Castle is chosen as the current quest at the beginning o the quest phase, two things happen. First, the players reveal the faceup encounter card under that side quest and resolve its staging. Second, the players flip Storm the Castle over and make the side quest on the reverse side the current quest until the end of the phase. That side quest will remain in play until it is defeated.",
        "doNotRead": "Ulchor winced in pain as he fell back onto his throne. His sword clattered onto the floor when it fell from his hand. He groaned and clutched his side. “Ahhhhh, curse you interlopers! Curse you to death and darkness!”\n\nThe heroes looked at their defeated foe with grim faces, and their hands gripped the hilts of their weapons with white knuckles. Yet none of them moved.\n\n“What is justice for this fiend? ” asked one of the heroes, pointing at Ulchor with his sword.“Death he has earned — and worse. Yet I hesitate to strike a defeated for.”\n\n“Ha, ha, ha, ha!” laughed Ulchor, and he spat blood at the hero. “You followed me all this way, only to waver at the end.”\n\nUlchor looked at the heroes gathered around him with the wild eyes of a cornered animal, and he shouted, “You’re all cowards! Run back to whatever lands you crawled out of and cower. The Dark Lord will find you!”\n\nOne hero sheathed his sword and leaned close to Ulchor to say, “Each of us knows that Sauron seeks dominion over all Middle-earth, but he will come for you long before he finds us.”\n\nUlchor’s eyes went wide and he shook violently even as he glared at the hero.\n\n“Yes,” said another hero sheathing her blade as well, “I imagine your Dark Lord looks unfavorably upon defeat,” She smiled and said to Ulchor, “What do you think your Master will do when He learns that you lost your fortress and allowed your slaves to escape?”\n\nUlchor moved his mouth, but no sound came out. The once-proud sorcerer was now reduced to a feeble man slumped on his chair. One by one, each of the heroes sheathed their weapons and turned to leave.\n\nOutside the throne room, the sounds of battle had quieted. News of Ulchor’s defeat spread quickly through Dol Rhugar, and his servants lost their will to fight, throwing down their weapons an fleeing into the night.\n\nBut there was no time for the heroes or their companions to celebrate; they reasoned it would only be one day before The Dark Tower was alerted to the fall of Dol Rhugar. It would take perhaps two more days after that for the soldiers of Mordor to arrive and retake the fortress. By that time, the heroes planned to be in Rhûn.\n\nThey disguised themselves in the armor of the soldiers of Nurn, and they loaded the rescued captives into the caged wagons used by the Easterlings to trade slaves. So it was that after several days of hard riding, they finally arrived at the City of Ulfast with news of Ulchor’s defeat.\n\nThe King bellowed with laughter when he heard of all that happened. “With an army of slaves you bested the Thane of Nurn in his own castle? What a triumph!” He clapped his hands and roared to his servants, “Prepare a table for my guests. We must celebrate!”\n\nThat evening at the Kings table, the King of Ulfast raised his glass in a toast to the heroes: “To our intrepid guests! For helping us to cast off the yoke of Mordor, you have earned the friendship of UIfast. May songs of your deeds be sung in every corner of Middle-earth!”\n\nThe heroes lifted their glasses to salute the King, and they all drank together in friendship.\n\n—————\n\nThane Ulchor awoke chained to a wall in the dungeons of Barad-dûr: His wounds had been tended, but his body ached. His eyes winced when the door was opened and bright torch-light shone into his cell.\n\nA tall figure in sable armor strode in. His armored footfalls echoed sharply off the walls until he stood over Ulchor and spoke: “Greetings, Ulchor, Thane of Nurn. I am The Mouth of Sauron.”\n\nUlchor struggled to turn his head and look up to see that it was him. The helmeted man smiled at him mockingly.\n\n“Our master is ill pleased to learn you have failed him a second time,” the Mouth said in a cold voice. “You were nearly dead when I found you in Nurn: Your castle in tatters, and your captives escaped. You have much to answer for. It will be a small comfort to The Dark Lord to know that you survived; He is looking forward to questioning you Himself.”\n\nUlchor wept.",

        "flavorIntro": "The funeral in Lossarnach had been a somber affair. Within the confines of a family mausoleum, surrounded by kin and the vassals of her departed father, Morwen Steelsheen had not wept. She was a queen, stoic and tall, of the blood of Númenor. She remained by the tomb seven davs and seven nights, a black gown and belt of white chrysanthemum her only adornments.\n\nIn the absence of her husband Thengel, King of Rohan, Morwen was guarded at all times by several companions — heroes, chosen from among the mighty and the wise as her honor guard. The last was a noble of Rohan, a man called Gálmód, who had been her close friend and advocate in court since her arrival many years ago.\n\nWhen her vigil had ended and the last of the mourners departed, only then did Morwen Steelsheen allow a pang of sadness to cross her face. Then she kissed the cold, white stone of her father’s sarcophagus, straightened herself, and emerged into the chill of an autumn morning. The honor guard followed close behind, joined by a column of Gálmód’s mounted Rohirrim.\n\nIt was this band which ventured from the Vale of Flowers toward the borders of Rohan, where Morwen’s king — and kingdom — awaited. “You must be pleased ot return home, my lady,” said one of the heroes.\n\n“Home,” said the queen. “I dare not linger on the thought. In my years I have dwelt on the shores of Belfalas and the green valleys of Lossarnach, yet now when I think of home I think only of the tapestries hanging in Meduseld. Of warm mead and kindly kin. Of Rohan, of the tribe of horse-lords which have so well adopted me.”\n\n“Rohan has been a good home to many,” said Gálmód. “Though not to all.” A raven passed overhead, dark and silent as it disappeared into a plume of mist pouring from Mindolluin and the great White Mountains beyond.\n\nThe group stayed an evening in the great city of Minas Tirith, where the aging steward feasted Morwen and her companions. In the morning they continued on, but they had not yet traveled a league before they were hailed by a lone rider on the road.\n\n“My queen,” said the rider, lowering his hood.\n\n“Thorongil,” said Morwen, embracing him. “Long has it been since you graced our halls at Edoras.”\n\n“I come with ill news,” he told her.\n\n“What have you seen, ranger?” asked Gálmód. “Orcs come down from the mountains?”\n\n“Aye, orcs and strange men.”\n\n“Phaw,” said Gálmód. “Foolish warnings from foolish wanderers. The queen has men enough to ward of mere ruffians.”\n\n“I thank you for the warning, master ranger.” Morwen bowed in her saddle.\n\n“I must away,” said Thorongil. “Heed my words,” he added, looking upon Gálmód. The ranger spurred his horse and continued at a trot toward the white city of Minas Tirith.\n\nDays later, the party had finally rounded the bend in a long road and now journeyed with the Drúadan Forest at their left shoulder. Before them stretched the broad grassy lands of Anórien.\n\nOne of the heroes gripped the bow slung across the horn of her saddle. “Thorongil’s warning perplexes me. We should shelter in the encampment at Erelas for the night.”\n\n“My men shall scout ahead,” said Gálmód. He signalled one of his captains, and the Rohirrim set of toward the bald green hill of Erelas and the encampment in its shadow. Gálmód remained behind. He tugged at his hauberk and clenched the pommel of his sword. “My queen,” he said, but he soon fell silent.\n\nAs the day wore into evening, one of the heroes frowned. “Your scouts have not returned. Gálmód.”\n\n“Indeed.” said the noble. “Something must have delayed them in Erelas. It is not far now.”\n\nThe settlement was oddly quiet. The heroes caught the flicker of a torch, a manlike shape loping into the shadow of a barn and disappearing. “Something’s not right,” said Morwen.\n\nAs she spoke a dark bird swept over the crossroads, soaring high, streaking through the moonlight and descending in an arc. But it was not a bird. It was an arrow, one of many, darkening the air.\n\n“The queen!” cried Gálmód. “Protect the queen!” He wheeled his horse, blade high and flashing as the flock of arrows came, followed by voices, howling in a strange tongue the words for blood and gold and fire.",

        "doNotRead": "As the brigand ringleader fell to his knees, the enemy host scattered into the hills. “Scum!” cried Gálmód, wild-eyed and panting.\n\nQueen Morwen knelt before the captured enemy. “What wickedness brings you to this place?” she asked.\n\nThe ringleader smirked. He muttered something.\n\n“He speaks the tongue of Dunland,” said one of the heroes. “Dunlendings this far east? Surely they would have been spoted.”\n\n“He curses us!” said Gálmód. “The cur besmirches the very name of Queen Morwen.”\n\n“No,” said one of the heroes. “I can almost make it out. He’s saying-”\n\nThen Gálmód unsheathed his dagger and flew with a frantic brutality onto the Dunlending, plunging his blade into the prisoner’s heart.\n\n“Gálmód!” The heroes dragged away the furious nobleman, his limbs flailing wildly.\n\nThe brigand fell into the dirt, his face stained with a look of pain and disappointment.\n\n“He wasn’t cursing us,” said the hero. “Gálmód, he was taunting us. He was teling us where they plan to strike next.\n\n“Not strike,” said another. “Struck.”\n\nThere need be no more words. Morwen stood, her face mottled with ash and blood and soil. She looked to the hilltop in the distance and saw the dark shapes of men working furtively, half-masked by the haze of night. “Erelas,” she said. “The beacon. They’ve captured the beacon.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Racing toward the hill of Erelas, the heroes felt a surge of fear. The beacon atop the hill had been guarded by only a token force, hardly enough to handle a surprise attack like this. What had long stood as a signal of peace and safety was now crawling with Dunlendings.\n\nSoon the heroes had left behind the encampment and began the arduous climb up the hill. Here and there the hill was girdled by a narrow stair carved in stone, but elsewhere the pathway had fallen into disrepair, and the masonry gave way to bare slate and slick moss. The heroes and their companions climbed chiefly in silence.\n\n“What could they want with the beacon?” mumbled Gálmód, his back hunched as he climbed a rocky slope toward the beacon.\n\n“Nothing good,” said one of the heroes. “It is used as a signal between Minas Tirith and Anórien. While it is captured, any call for aid or warning of attack would be long-delayed.”\n\nBy the time they arrived at the edge of the beacon’s platform, the heroes could overhear their enemies conversing brokenly in the language of the Rohirrim.\n\nOne of the heroes raised her head to peer into the darkness over a crumbling balustrade. Acrew of scowling Dunlendings were addressing a Rohirrim rider wearing a helm with a white plume. The Rohirrim kept one hand on the pommel of his blade. “You are late,” he said.\n\n“Trouble in the camp below,” said one of the Dunlendings.\n\n“You straw-heads put up a fight,” said another.\n\n“And you dealt with them?” said the Rohirrim.\n\n“Dead.”\n\n“Have you brought the payment?” The Rohirrim extended his hand, and one of the Dunlendings begrudgingly clapped a purse of coins into it. “Then the beacon is yours.” He tossed the pouch into the air and caught it ni one hand.\n\nSignalling a cadre of his fellow warriors, the rider strolled past the Dunlendings. “Make it look convincing,” he said.\n\n“Treachery among the ranks,” whispered the hero.\n\n“They shall pay with their lives for turning against kith and king.” said Gálmód. “May the blood of Eorl rebel against their very veins. Let us take the hill and light this valley with the death-pyres of traitors.”\n\n“Calm, Gálmód.” One of the heroes notched an arrow. “It is more important to hold the beacon than to seek revenge.”\n\n“Then prepare yourselves,” said Gálmód, drawing his sword. “For true queen and honored kin. For the sons and daughters of Rohan!”",

        "doNotRead": "After hours of bloody fighting, the sun rose above the bald hill of Erelas. There, joined at last by Gálmód’s scouts, the heroes took stock of the battlefield.\n\n“There were traitor Rohirrim among this group,” said one ofthe heroes.\n\n“But how could they betray their kingdom?” asked another. “And to what end?”\n\n“There is a conspiracy afoot,” said Queen Morwen. “Though how vast the net and how many of us shall be ensnared, I cannot guess.”\n\nGálmód nudged the body of one of the slain enemies with the tip of his boot. “This one wears an odd sigil. A white horse on a field of red.” His hands grasped the enemy’s cape and tore it from the traitor’s shoulders. He began to fold it. “This is not over,” he said.\n\n“Rogues,” said Morwen. “We must return to Edoras at once.”\n\nAt this, one of Gálmód’s riders spoke up. “This brings the reason for our delay, my queen. On our scouting, we intercepted a messenger from Aldburg. He brought word that an orc-host has crossed the Anduin and begun raiding in the Eastfold.”\n\n“Just as Thorongil warned,” sneered Gálmód. “Perhaps the ranger bore some wisdom after all.”\n\n“Then we must make haste ot Aldburg,” said Morwen. “For our wick is now burning from both ends. If we cannot beat back these raiders, I fear we will crumble from within.”",

The Eastfold looked just as it did in the tapestries of Edoras and the Books of Kings: pleasant, pastoral, and vast. The riders bent their heads into the wind and urged their steeds onward, for they had received word from Gálmód’s scouts that an orc-host had crossed the Anduin and begun marching toward the city of Aldburg. Worse yet, they seemed to be raiding horse farms on the way, strengthening their numbers with heavy war horses and butchering those who stood in their path.\n\n“I grow concerned,” said one of the heroes. “Orcs assault the countryside just as wild-men strike at the border.”\n\n“Aye.” said another: “The realm of the horse-lords is caught between the forge and the fire.”\n\n“We shall seek aid at Aldburg.” said Queen Morwen. “Éomund is the Marshal there. He is young and brash, but valiant. He will surely supply us with aid.”\n\n“We may not have time,” called one of the heroes. “Look ahead!” He pointed toward a pillar of smoke twisting in the distance.\n\n“That smoke may be from the kingly stables of Thengel himself.” said Gálmód. “Woe to any orc who would desecrate the descendants of the Mearas with rotten whip or rusted spur.”\n\nCresting a bald green hill, the heroes came upon a small orcish raiding party, its members tugging at the reins of two great horses. Turning to witness the clamor, one of the orcs shouted to the others — “Go get Thruk!” he bellowed. “Thruk’ll spike ’em dead!”\n\n“We must have caught them on their way back to the main force,” said Morwen.\n\nThe captured horses were gorgeous, saddled for war, bodies strong and elegant in the light of morning.\n\n“Flinthoof! Brightmane!” called Gálmód. “The king’s own horses. But where is their liege, Felaróf the Mighty?”\n\nThe orc hefted his mass onto the stallion called Flinthoof. Brightmane, wild-eyed and bucking. jerked away from the orc and galloped for the hills.\n\n“Let us rout them,” said one of the heroes. “For the blood of horses! For the horses of kings!” They gathered their weapons and prepared to charge. Down the hills and over the orcs they rode, coursing across the sunlit fields, to battle.",

        "doNotRead": "The heroes made their final charge against the orcs, their steeds mighty and noble and valorous, trampling their former captors. Shattered and broken, the orcish mob fled east, and soon they were driven from sight.\n\n“This is not the last we will see of that loathsome band,” said Gálmód. “We should press onward.”\n\n“Not alone,” said Queen Morwen. “Not without the might of Rohan at our backs. We must ride to the city of Aldburg. There we can warn Éomund. He is Marshal of the East-mark, advised by the wise and patient Ealdwulf. Together they will bring their forces to bear against the horde. Perhaps then we can uncover the truth behind the traitors who surrendered the beacon at Erelas. The sigil of the red field and white stallion.”\n\nThe heroes and their companions were greeted well in Aldburg, where they feasted and slept for the first time in what felt like years. It was there they met Ealdwulf, one of the most powerful nobles in Rohan and chief advisor to the young Marshal Éomund.\n\n“Your warnings are dire,” said Ealdwulf, sipping wine from a golden goblet. The fire crackled in his feasting-hall as the heroes and their companions conferred. “And they are appreciated. The Marshal will hear of this immediately, and my cored will ride at first dawn to the Anduin. They will not rest until they have avenged the sullying of our land. It is this other matter which concerns me.” he said. “Traitors amongst us. I have some thoughts on the matter, for the white horse on a red field is no strange symbol to the men of Aldburg. But for tonight, let us take stock and consider our options. In the morning. I shall tell you all I know.”",

For the Gift.”\n\nHe steeled himself. “For the Gift.”\n\nLate that night, the heroes were roused from an unsteady sleep by Ealdwulf himself. The crags of his face were licked by shadow. All else was darkness. “It is not yet dawn,” he said. “I have ill news.”\n\n“What tidings, master Ealdwulf?” said one of the heroes.\n\n“A rider of Rohan has turned himself in,” said the old lord.\n\n“For the slaughter at Erelas. For treason.” The word hit like a hammer. “He has told the guards that the rest of his comrades will move to depose Lord Éomund before dawn. That even our trusted spy master has turned against us in service of a devilish conspiracy.”\n\n“We must go to the guards,” said a hero, lacing her hauberk. “Perhaps we can wring some details from this prisoner.”\n\n“I feel the noose ever-tightening.” said Ealdwulf. “The traitors are within the walls now. Better not to tip our hand that we have become aware of their duplicity. My friends, root out this treason, or the Eastmark shall surely crumble from within — and with it, the soul of Rohan.”\n\nWith that, the heroes outfitted themselves and made their way to the quiet streets of Aldburg. “Shall we go to the barracks, then?” said one.\n\nAs they passed by a seamy tavern called The Horse’s Tail, they caught a whisper of hushed conversation. “Assassin?” said one of the patrons. “In Aldburg?”\n\n“Tavern or barracks,” said a hero. “Shall we toss a coin?”",

Come, soldiers. Where is Gálmód Worm-heart? Gúthwinë thirsts for the wretch’s ignoble blood.”\n\nJust then, a man of the marshall’s éored burst into the room . “My lord!

He was an old man, though with a royal bearing. He had the broad shoulders of a warrior, and remained unbent ni his old age.\n\n“That sigil is well-known ni Aldburg,” he said. “For it was the coat of arms of Haleth, princely son of Helm Hammerhand. He was well-loved by the men here. They still celebrate his valour in the Old War against Dunland. When he died…” Ealdwulf paused. “When he and his brother perished, the line of succession was broken. And so the crown of Rohan passed to the grandfathers of Thengel-king.”\n\n“Could it be Gálmód and his men seek to restore the line of Haleth?” said a hero.\n\n“Imposible,” said Éomund. “The bloodline of Haleth has withered. Or so it is said.”\n\n“Nothing si impossible, my lord,” said Ealdwulf. “For brother is set against brother, and blood turns against blood. Every oath of Man si at hazard.”\n\n“Go, my friends,” said Éomund. “Ride for the Eastemnet. Prove yourselves upon this oath of oaths. Find Gálmód. Find him and bring him back.”\n\nAnd so the heroes rode, day upon day, wills bound to the promise of justice. Their oath propelled them ever forward, through gale and pulse of heat. They visited the hamlets of decent folk — horse-breeders and plowmen, laborers who smelt of salt and straw and took their meals with a smile. Many such villages did the heroes visit, and each offered the same unanswerable question. “How many would see their king deposed? How many would betray their people in the name of some faithless usurper?” As they journeyed, this uncertainty grew. Each village seemed a little grayer, a little less kindly. They slept little, and when they did it was roughly, in empty fields or in the stables amid the nickering of half-broken geldings and dark-eyed mares.\n\nIt was on one such night, looking outward on the endless plains, that they spotted a familiar glow ni the distance. Against the purple curtain of dusk, a hand of fire rose up, and with it the smell of smoke and burnt grass. And something fouler still, something they recognized at once.\n\n“Orcs,” said one of the heroes. “The scattered host has been made whole.”\n\n“Then we shall unmake them,” said another.",
        "ruling": "**Wild Steeds & Captured Steeds**\n\nWhen setting up the scenario, stage 1A instructs the players to put the objective cards Wild Steeds and Captured Steeds into the staging area.

        "doNotRead": "At last the heroes rallied, pushing the orc-host to the very banks of the Anduin.\n\n“Ride!” cried a hero. “Ride this rabble into the river’s rush!” And with one great charge, the heroes leapt among the routed orcs, and their foes leapt from the rocks or fled into the river to be washed away like bracken.\n\nThe heroes gathered what horses remained, returning them to the fields  and stables. “This well and good we stopped these thieves,” said one of the heroes. “For if war so to fall upon Rohan, she will have need of fresh horses.”\n\nThat night, as they oiled their blades and sang songs on the riverbank, the heroes were approached by a lone rider. A scout, who removed his helmet and bent his head.\n\n“Welcome, man of Rohan. Rest by our fire a while. You have missed quite a skirmish.”\n\n“It was the smoke and screaming by which I found you, masters. I bear a message from Lord Éomund. Gálmód has been spotted crossing the Entwade into the western plains. He is laying low, traveling slowly by night. My Lord summons you to fulfill your vow.\n\n“Then west shall we ride,” said one of the heroes. “For westward lies honor and oath.”",

        "flavorIntro": "They rode west at once, fording at the Entwade, their faces grim, their steeds panting. After his treachery at Aldburg, the coward Gálmód had fled into the countryside, traveling by night to escape Rohan and the wrath of the marshal, lord Éomund. Now he had been spotted crossing the Snowbourn, only some days ahead, as he broke across the hills of the Westfold for the Gap of Rohan and the wilderness beyond.\n\n“He shall not escape,” said one of the heroes. “He shall answer for his treason.”\n\n“Such was our oath,” said another.\n\nHere and there the landscape became hilly and steep before opening to vast fields of grass and long wide valleys. A cool air swept up from the White Mountains in the distant south. The riders did not stop. They did not stop when the road grew violet and dusky, nor when the sun fell behind the Hornburg and drenched the land in shadow. They did not stop for the patrolling éored riding by torchlight, for the heroes knew among themselves that Gálmód’s conspiracy was more enormous than they had yet seen, a great web spanning the armies of Rohan and her royal halls, from the west and the east, from without and within. A soldier of the Rohirrim hailed the heroes and they rode on, silent as shadows.\n\nIt was three days before they found his trail, some miles past the great fortress at Helm’s Deep where the king of old had waged bitter war against the Dunlendings. Three days of tireless vigil, of stomachs empty as stones, of aching thighs, of horses with eyes black as marbles and wild as a nightmare.\n\nAs they rode it felt as if seasons passed; the warm weather which they had enjoyed so well now faded with every hoofbeat. Summer was gone, then autumn, and they could feel upon the air a great stillness, and dread accumulated among them for each could feel the building of a cold storm, a cruel storm, a ragged and vicious blizzard awaiting them.\n\nThere was no further warning. The storm closed upon them like a great white mouth, buffeting them, threatening to tear the very cloaks from their shoulders. The snow fell in an incredible white haze such that each hero could not see the nose of his own horse.\n\n“Gálmód has no care for himself.” shouted a hero. “He rides to his death.”\n\n“This is no ordinary storm,” said another. “He is driven by terror.”\n\nOnward and on, and soon they found themselves in the great Gap of Rohan. Behind them lay the wide gorgeous lands of the Horse-lords, to the left the White Mountains, to the right the Misty Mountains from which oft descended goblins and hungry orcs. Ahead lay Dunland, where Gálmód would surely find shelter amid his confederates.\n\nWithin the hour the snow had risen to their knees. Some miles before them in the distance, the traitor ran fleetingly into the cold and sudden white.\n\n“Ride on,” said a hero.\n\n“After you,” replied another. “For oath and honor.”",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "Exhausted, beleaguered, rattling from cold, Gálmód fell to his knees. All about them was a wilderness of snow and stone, a fierce blizzard threatening to rip even the mountains from their roots. A few of the Dunlendings threw down their arms with such force that the blades and spears vanished into the snowbanks. Others scattered upon horseback, weaving crooked trails to the west and north.\n\nThose who remained were bound roughly. “We ought to get them out of the cold,” said one of the heroes. “They may be brigands and brutes, but they ought not freeze to death.”\n\n“There is no shelter,” said another. “The nearest perhaps is the Glittering Caves which run beneath these mountains, beneath the king’s old fortress at Helm’s Deep.\n\n“We’ve no choice. Come, where is Gálmód? Bring him before us.”\n\nThe traitor had been lying in a snowbank, and at the mention of his name he stirred. “I was a fool,” said Gálmód. “A fool.” His teeth chattered such that it seemed they might shatter in his jaw. The flesh on his hands and cheeks and nose was a pale, unnerving purple.\n\n“A fool to betray your people,” said one of the heroes. “You bartered the beacon at Erelas to the Dunlendings. The life of Queen Morwen. The seat of Lord Éomund and the throne of his liege. Each of these you’ve forsworn, and with each betrayal you’ve sullied your house for a generation.”\n\n“I did. I was,” said Gálmód. “But the hill-folk. The Gift. I sought to help them. This is not our land. I only sought...he used them. He used me. Please, there isn’t much time. Please.”\n\n“There will be no talking your way out of this,” said one of the heroes, hoisting the captive to his feet. “We’ll get to shelter. And when this storm passes, we shall take you back to Edoras for trial.”\n\nThe traitor Gálmód looked up for the first time and the heroes saw him perhaps for the first time as he truly was. He was afraid. Beaten. A shivering animal, his ice-blue eyes bloodshot and full of shame. He looked upon the heroes, and for a moment his expression softened. Then, his gaze fell behind the heroes.\n\nGálmód shrieked. His lungs wheezing, his eyes grew huge and fearful. Falling to his knees, he could not look away. The heroes turned and followed his gaze, and there upon a snowy bluff, backshot by a cold moon, his head bedecked in a horned helm of leather and gold, stood a man both tall and broad. His hands were bare, blackened by frostbite, his armor cracked and broken to reveal a body of dust and ice and ash. All about him the storm swirled, the man like a broken tower standing at its epicenter, looking down upon the party, his shriek delirious and violent and carried for miles by an endless, vengeful wind.",

        "flavorIntro": "A great gale blew across the Gap of Rohan and across the battlefield where the heroes had captured the traitor Gálmód. His Dunlending guard, what was left of them, had flung their blades into the snow and begged mercy in the guttural tongue of the hillmen. The rushing wind carried with it the sound of a dread shriek, a calamitous wailing which echoed darkly among the snowbanks.\n\nAll turned, victor and captive, traitor and true, to the scream’s source. A single foe, standing lonesome on the ridge, its form at once spectral and fleshly. For such a thing could be naught but a foe, though decked in the garb of ancient Rohan. Its face was the pure spite of one cursed to wander after death, its seething scream a razor upon the very wind.\n\n“It cannot be,” stammered Gálmód. “It cannot be! ’Tis the wraith of King Helm the Accursed. The Bane of Dunland. The Hammerhand. Helm is arisen and back to war.”\n\nThen the scream upon the wind became a growl, and the growl a voice so deep it rumbled the very roots of the mountains. “I smel the reek of Dunland.” It took a step forward, then another. “Come, traitors. Come, so I may feel your bones break beneath my fists.”\n\nAt once the wind rose and pelted the heroes with ice. Soon none could see the person next to them. Nor could they see the king’s wraith as it stalked the storm, quiet and desolate as a shadow, moving among the snowblind captives, its fists tearing and smashing, the captives slumping one by one like broken dolls. When a body fell at Gálmód’s feet and the traitor looked up, he saw the perilous figure, the bitter king, raising his fists.\n\n“Fly!” cried one of the heroes. “Fly! The king is not himself. He is cursed with bloodlust.”\n\n“There is no shelter,” cried another. “We cannot defeat him with force of arms!”\n\n“There was a cave,” said the last. “I remember we passed a cave.”\n\nThey fled. Gálmód followed close behind the heroes. Driven by terror above all, the Dunlending captives scattered. Amid the blustering wind walked the wraith, implacable.\n\nThey found the cave. A small crevice it was, which opened up to a vast chamber below, rife with stones which glinted and glimmered in the flicker of torchlight. “The Glittering Caves,” said one hero. “These tunnels lead all the way to the depths beneath the Hornburg and the fortress of Helm’s Deep. And where are our captives? Some of them no doubt skulk in the tunnels below. Fear has made them mad.”\n\n“We must press onward,” said another. “The wraith will not stop.”\n\n“It is said the king was unstoppable in battle, unleashed by the fury of his battle-horn. Perhaps if we can find it we may yet call him to his senses.\n\nAnd so, the heroes went deeper, blades at the ready, and the snow piled behind them until the cave’s throat was a wall of ice, and the ghost of Lord Helm stalked the caves with his ears pricked for the sounds of men.",
        "ruling": "**The Cave Card Type**\n\nThe 12 cards from the Exploring the Caves encounter set are “cave” cards, a new card type introduced in this scenario. Caves are immune to player card effects. Throughout the game, players move unique tokens representing themselves and Helm Hammerhand around a 4-by-3 grid of cave cards, called the Caves Map. When a player’s token is on a cave, that player and each character that player controls are considered to be at that cave. Travel actions on caves can only be performed by a player at that cave. Other game mechanics, like ranged and sentinel, function as normal, even while players are at different caves.\n\n**Adjacent vs. Connected Caves**\n\nTwo caves are called **adjacent** if they occupy neighboring positions in the Caves Map. Diagonal caves are **not adjacent**. Two **adjacent** caves are also called **connected** if the artwork on their shared border shows a continuous path.\n\n**Setting Up the Caves Map**\n\n1. Shuffle the caves together and deal them faceup in a 4-across, 3-down grid in their own play area.\n\n2. Starting with the first player, each player takes turns swapping any 2 **adjacent** caves in the Caves Map. The players may make up to 6 swaps in this way. After the swaps, if any cave cannot be reached from the top-left cave by a continuous path of **connected** caves, raise each player’s threat by 1 and return to step 1. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.\n\n3. Each player places a unique player token on the top-left cave (this does not count as moving to that cave). These tokens can be anything as long as they are different from the standard game tokens. Place another unique token on the bottom-right cave. This is Helm Hammerhand’s token and marks his current cave.\n\n**Clues**\n\nClues are facedown cards attached to caves. To set up the clues:\n\n1. Shuffle the 12 cards of the Search for the Horn encounter set together to form the Clue Deck. Look at the top 2 [player] cards, and place a resource token on each cave indicated by name in the bottom right corner of those cards. If all of the indicated caves are in the left half of the Caves Map, remove all resource tokens from the Caves Map and repeat this step.\n\n2. Remove the bottom card of the Clue Deck from the game without looking at it. The cave indicated on this card represents the secret whereabouts of Helm’s Horn.\n\n3. Shuffle the 11 remaining cards of the Clue Deck together again and attach 1 card from it facedown to each cave with a resource token. Then, remove all resource tokens from the Caves Map.\n\n4. Look at the remainder of the Clue Deck and place a damage token on each indicated cave. These have been ruled out as possible places for Helm’s Horn. Shuffle the looked at cards into the encounter deck.\n\nTo move a player or Helm Hammerhand to another cave, move the corresponding unique token to that cave. Typically, when players move, they must move to a **connected** cave. Helm Hammerhand, being a wraith, typically moves to an **adjacent** cave, regardless of whether that cave happens to be **connected**. If Helm Hammerhand is instructed to move toward the nearest player, and there exist multiple equidistant paths toward a nearest player, the first player decides which of those paths Helm Hammerhand will take.\n\n**“Search This Cave”**\n\nThe text “search this cave” is found in a travel action on each cave in the Caves Map. It represents the players searching that cave for a clue to the whereabouts of Helm’s Horn, so that they can find the horn and sound it in Helm’s presence to quell the vengeful spirit.\n\nTo “search this cave”, reveal the clue card attached to that cave as if it were revealed by the encounter deck. After resolving the staging of the clue card, add a damage token to the cave indicated in the clue card’s bottom right corner. You cannot search a cave if it has no attached clue.\n\nAfter all the clues have been revealed, only 1 undamaged cave will remain, corresponding to the card that was removed from the game during the Caves Map setup.\n\n**Hard Mode**\n\nThe Glittering Caves has an additional difficulty mode called hard mode. To play in hard mode, during step 1 of setting up the clues, look at the top 10 cards of the Clues Deck instead of only the top 2 [player] cards.",
        "doNotRead": "At last the heroes battled the wraith to a standstill, and in a moment of great clamor one of them pressed his lips again to the horn, and as he blew there came a great resounding boom, and the defeated shade for a moment became flesh again, and the noise of battle receded like an echo.\n\n“That sound,” said the king. His rageful face softened, and in the glittering light he resembled a man, tall and fair, as he appeared in the tapestries at Meduseld. “My sons are calling me home,” said Helm, his gaze weakening. “Onward, good Rohirrim. Onward to the Golden Hall for feast and fellowship. Onward, and drink to the end of suffering.”\n\nHis gaze lingered upon Gálmód, an expression of pity perhaps, and sorrow. The traitor quavered. Tears welled in his eyes and he let out a single bitter sob. “My king!” he cried, reaching for the shade. But the king was gone, fading like a dream. Gálmód fell to his knees. “So passes Rohan,” he said. “For as her greatest king falls to ruin, so shall her people. Shades. Shades now are the Rohirrim. Shades of the people we could have been and shall never be again.”",

        "flavorIntro": "Like all grand conspiracies, it had begun with a man tossing in his bedsheets, his mind swirling with half-remembered grudges and rotten chunks of envy. It was midnight in Aldburg and the old lord rose from his bed; he had not slept. He stood before a rack of armor: an empty shell, long shed. He was a warlord born to a time of war. A sword born bloody, and sheathed before its time. No longer. For all the kingsblood which ran through his grandfather’s veins, war was his only inheritance. His blade was polished.\n\nIn the dim of his bedchamber, while a solitary candle dripped and quavered, Ealdwulf accepted the truth. He girded himself in the broken armor of his godsire, Prince Haleth, the Red Stallion. He lashed a buckler to his tired, creaking arm.\n\nHe read the letter once more.\n\n    “Straw-hair Gálmód, we have made war\n    against the Erelas hill of flame. Our pact\n    remains unfulfilled. Return the land of green\n    hills to my people, as you have oath sworn.\n    Grimrede.”\n\nThe hillmen would have their Gift. And Ealdwulf would have his crown.\n\n————\n\nThe ragged party stopped along the footpath outside the Glittering Caves. There, bereft of hope, slumped the traitor Gálmód. “My heart is troubled,” he said. “I have looked in the eyes of a wraith and seen, I fear, my own fate.”\n\n“You have much to answer for,” said a hero. “A great oath has been broken.”\n\n“I have told you everything,” said Gálmód. “Of Ealdwulf’s bargain with the Dunlendings. His plan to cede territory in equal trade for hillmen spears and archers and blood. I sympathized with them. This is their land, by all rights. Every learned man knows of the purges, the routs, and the cruel feud. Their claim is the elder. To displace them was wrong. To live this way, unconscionable.”\n\n“But war!” cried the hero. “War on your own kin! You have shattered every oath of conscience, every honorable vow.”\n\n“My honor is long forfeit,” said Gálmód. “I begged of Queen Morwen. I begged of the king. Only Ealdwulf proved a sympathetic ear to the hillmen’s plight. I did not know, fool that I am, how he intended to use them — to use me. Now he has ensnared the Raven Clan chieftains with promises of land and steel and glory. As always, the cruelest warlords will rise to the top and the smallfolk will be slaughtered, Dunland and Eorling alike. I do not forswear the cause of the Dunlendings, but this war is beyond all wisdom.\n\n“The war may be over before it can begin,” said another hero. “Ealdwulf’s forces mass along the Isen. All the while, the armies of Rohan are abroad, hunting orcs and scouring for Gálmód Worm-heart.”\n\n“Then we must gather them,” said Gálmód. “I beg you. Don’t let the Old Wolf lure Dunland along the path of blood.”\n\n“As oaths fall aside, we must hold to ours with all our heart,” said a hero. “Let us muster the horse-lords. We shall ride to Edoras over the white peak of Írensaga and across the great grass sea. We shall rally those who still hold true to honor. Then we will ride to the halls of Ealdwulf and make him see reason, though my heart fears it is too late to turn him from this road.”",

        "doNotRead": "The halls of Ealdwulf had echoed with the clamor of clanging daggers and brute ax on stone but all was now silent. The assassins lay fallen, their impotent blades strewn about their bodies. “Ealdwulf has departed,” said a hero, “his halls empty but for a catspaw and a killer. Would that they had turned their wiles to feeding a village or chasing of horse thieves.”\n\n“And while we rode, Ealdwulf wriggled across the Isen,” said another. “War is inevitable.”\n\n“A battle is inevitable,” said the last. “But if Ealdwulf Oathbreaker is captured and his ancestral claim renounced as folly, we may yet forestall the worst of it. I would not see brother slay brother in service of one old man’s greed.”\n\n“Then we must ride,” said the hero. “For Rohan’s great tapestry is affray, and the bitter lord would rend it all with one last tug. Let us ride, servants of the Mark, for the keeping of our oath will see the crowning of our honor.”",

        "flavorIntro": "The enemies of Rohan gathered upon the far bank of the Isen. There they amassed, wild-haired Dunlendings from the clans of the Boar, the Wolf, and the Raven. There they sharpened their axes and scarred their flesh and howled in fell ritual. There among the rocks and rills crossed the traitor Ealdwulf, misbegotten prince of a forgotten royal line. There the hooves of his stallion splashed on the fords, and there behind him filed his riders: a grim cavalry of oathbreakers, of second sons, of those born without honor and those who had willingly cast it aside.\n\nThe traitor looked upon his armies, the hillmen and the horse-lords, and he frowned. “Grimede,” he said. “The time of your destiny has arrived.”\n\nThe warlord pushed a calloused hand through his hair. “We do not believe in destiny, grey-head. We fight for the home you have promised. Nothing less could bring together the three clans.”\n\n“My destiny, then,” said Ealdwulf. “The destiny of my forebears. The line of Haleth restored at last.”\n\n“I see through you,” said Grimrede. “You have no sons. You are an old man. You do not want to rule. You want to conquer.”\n\n“And what of your son?” said Ealdwulf. “What of your snarling little boy? Do you not wish him to lead the Raven clan after you have perished?”\n\nGrimrede shook his head. “Turch has not chosen his clan. Soon, the spirits will reveal themselves to him and he will choose his path. Amid the hills we have no care for the blood of kings. Lord Son of Lord, King Son of King. We follow our own ways — the ways of spirit and bone.”\n\n“Bone or blood, iron or gold. I care not. Win me this kingdom and you shall have a place in it. A Gift, long overdue, from one great lord to another.”\n\nThe warlord Grimrede went into the camp. There he consulted with his shamans, the bearded ones who found omens amid knucklebones. There they dispensed their wisdom and shared their foresight and watched with great awe as the moon spirit crested the vast lands to the east.\n\n—————\n\nBefore they could see it, the heroes heard the burbling waters of the Isen. At the head of his army, King Thengel of Rohan spoke with great solemnity. “We are nearing the borders. Ealdwulf and his men will move soon. We are riding on the eve of war.”\n\n“As a gardener plucks a weed , so will we stop Ealdwulf. Before the roots of his treachery further strangle this land.”\n\nThe traitor Gálmód walked behind in shackles. “Grimede refuses to march across the fords until the spirits deem it so,” he said. “They will not march without the approval of the moon.”\n\nOne hero pointed up at the night sky, where a great yellow moon hung like a pendant. “It seems the moon has given his answer.”\n\n“Then we have little time,” said Gálmód. “War is upon us. Please, unchain me. Place a dagger in my hand and let me fight to right my wrongs. If not for my honor, then for the honor of my house. I do not wish for my son to be raised the child of a coward.”\n\n“No,” said Thengel. “You are no longer a man of Rohan. You are a prisoner, nothing more.”\n\nGálmód grimaced. “Perhaps. Yet upon the battlefield I will not be parted from my king and his course.”\n\nThe king did not reply. The band rode on. They rode to the shores of the river Isen where they heard the drums of battle and the chattering of men prepared to die. The heroes drew their weapons.\n\n“We must cross the fords,” said one. “The warlord and his conspirator await just across the stream.”\n\nThe shoreline swarmed with Dunlendings of three clans, and the valley echoed with wolf-cries, the shouts of ravens, the squeal and growl of a mighty boar. Blades glinted. The sun began to rise. Pacing the water’s edge, shoulders decked in dirty leather, was the chieftain Grimrede.\n\n“He is waiting for us”, said Thengel. “Our mighty foe.”\n\n“Then to battle!” cried a hero. “For Rohan! For oath and honor!”",
        "ruling": "",
        "doNotRead": "Like a coney run down by baying dogs, Ealdwulf seemed small, nearly pitiable. Thrown from his horse, he was now nothing more than a sneering old man. A misguided, venomous thing. A fool. His guards dispatched, his stallion panting by the stream with great dark nostrils and a curling cloud of steam. The knees of Ealdwulf’s trousers wet and streaked with dirt. But he was not empty-handed.\n\n“Put down your sword,” said one of the heroes. “Come peacefully. Your folly has caused enough pain.”\n\n”This was my grandfather’s blade,” said Ealdwulf, “and his grandfather’s. Great Haleth wielded it as a prince of Rohan. As do I.”\n\nThe others gathered about Ealdwulf in a circle. The heroes. King Thengel in gleaming armor. Gálmód in chains, panting, disheveled. In the chaos of battle he had escaped his guards and ridden to the king’s side.\n\n“Perhaps your blood made you a prince,” said Thengel. “But you are no man of Rohan. You will die on the banks of the River Isen like a common brigand. An orc. A poacher of horses.”\n\n“Do not taunt me, cousin.” Ealdwulf raised his blade and for a moment he was again a great warrior. He moved with the speed and grace of a man half his age, raging toward King Thengel in a blur.\n\n“The king!” cried Gálmód. “Protect the king!” He staggered between the two, his chains held high and flashing as the blade came.\n\nGálmód was slain. Then Ealdwulf. The war was ended.\n\nThengel sunk to his knees. He cradled Gálmód in his arms. The king’s face was streaked with bitter tears. “Break his shackles,” he said. “Break Gálmód’s shackles. He died a man of Rohan.”\n\nA hero came forth bearing a key, and the prisoner’s shackles fell to the dirt.\n\n—————\n\nThe funeral in Edoras was a somber affair. The hero Gálmód was laid to rest amid a field of simbelmynë. The women sang songs for him. New songs and old, of tricksters turned heroes. Of lost children returning home.\n\nHis son was among the mourners. Young Gríma watched pensively. He had heard the whispers of the Rohirrim these past weeks — that his father was stupid, easily ensnared by an enemy of Rohan. He resolved to make no such mistake.\n\nThe king placed his hands on the child’s shoulders. “You shall stay with us at Meduseld,” said Thengel. “Weep while you may. Keep your heart full for him, and words of his good deeds ever upon your tongue. You will be raised the son of a champion, and the ward of lords. As a man of Rohan shall you live and die.”\n\nThe boy felt a pang of spite for the king and his issue. Spite for the lordlings and ladies of the Golden Hall. For the heroism and valor for which his father died. Then he felt the kings’ hands upon his shoulders. The anger cleared from his face, and for a moment he was just a lad, aggrieved, fatherless, the white light of the sun dancing on his face.\n\n—————\n\nAcross the hills and mountains there was a second funeral. The corpse of chieftain Grimrede was laid upon the bier while his shamans cast bones and watched the skies with dreadful expectation. Ravens wheeled above, hungry. Soon they would descend and feast until nothing of Grimrede remained but bone. Such was the way of the Raven Clan.\n\nThe others had dispersed without ceremony. The Wolves in bloodied pelts descended first, and the Boars followed in turn. Young Turch watched them all go. His father’s alliance broken like clay on stone.\n\n“They will be at each other’s throats again.”\n\nTurch turned to see who had spoken — beside a dying fire, there crouched a man. A thin fellow, his flesh pale as the moon. At his waist he wore a belt of skulls. Upon his head he wore a helm of jagged antler and boar’s tusk. He prodded the embers with a stick. Turch felt cold.\n\n“There is only one way to unite the clans,” said the figure.\n\n“The crown is lost,” said Turch. “So my father told me.”\n\n“Not lost,” said the figure. “Hidden.”\n\n“Who — who are you?” said the boy.\n\n“I am,” said the figure. “Come along.”",

      "flavorIntro": "Today was not a good day for Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. In fact, if she didn't do something very soon to turn things around, her entire week—or even her whole year—would be ruined. You see, Mayor Pott himself had assigned her the very solemn duty of organizing this year's Overlithe feast in Hobbiton. This was a prestigious honor—much more important than stuck-up Lalia Clayhanger's mid-year feast. After all, Mid-year's Day happens every year, while Overlithe comes around only once every four.\n\nAs such, it was obviously very important that Lobelia's feast be bigger and better than Lalia's in every way—she needed to arrange for fancier decorations and more food than Lalia could possibly hope to pull together. That's why she was all the way out here in Michel Delving with less than a week to go: Old Bolgo baked the best pies in all the Shire, and Lobelia would settle for nothing short of the best.\n\n“The quantity isn't the problem Lobelia,” Bolgo was saying, “The problem is the delivery. My sons are out in the countryside right now, and with my bad back I couldn't possibly make the trip down to Hobbiton. Plus, I hear they caught some Big Folk ruffians snooping about near Waymoot last night; at my age I'd be a target. But you and Otho can come pick them up Lobelia cut him off.—”\n\n“Impossible! I am needed in Hobbiton already, to make the final preparations for the feast.” Bolgo gave a helpless shrug as Lobelia pivoted angrily on her heel, her face red.\n\nNot far away, her eight-year-old son, Lotho, played near the road. “Stop right there!” he shouted, brandishing a stick at several passing strangers. “I'm a Shirriff, and that means whatever I say goes! And I say this road is closed!”\n\nThe strangers looked at each other with bemusement. “Well then,” one of them said, a twinkle in her eye, “How ever are we to get to Bree? You don't know another way around, do you, young Shirriff?” At this, Lobelia's ears perked up and she hurried over.\n\n“Headed towards Bree, are you?” she asked, trying to sound sweet and welcoming, but unable to conceal the request on the tip of her tongue. “You'll have to pass through Hobbiton on your way, then.”\n\n“Yes,” one of the strangers said, “we were headed that way, though this lawman here has informed us that the road is closed.” At this he winked at the small boy.\n\nLobelia paid him no heed and continued. “It just so happens I need someone to help me with a little delivery. A shipment of pies, brought from Old Bolgo's here to the Hobbiton Party Tree in time for Overlithe, five days hence.” She thought for a moment, at war with herself about her next offer. “I suppose it'd only be proper to invite you to the feast as well. It's to be the finest feast the Shire has seen in years!” The strangers looked at one another, weighing their opinions by the looks on their faces. Then one spoke. “I suppose we're in no hurry. And it would be lovely to see the best of The Shire's hospitality before we're on our way.” The others nodded in agreement.\n\n“Perfect,” Lobelia said, rubbing her hands together. “I'll make the arrangements!”",

And not a moment too soon, too, I was beginning to worry I'd put my trust in the wrong sorts of folks,” she said, hastily gesturing towards where to put them. “They do smell wonderful, though. Bolgo does some great work—if I didn't know better, I would say they were fresh from the bakery no more than an hour ago!”\n\nThe heroes glanced at one another nervously, nodding in agreement. What Lobelia didn't know wouldn't hurt her! They silently agreed: their trip to the Hobbiton bakery would forever remain a secret.",

      "flavorIntro": "Lobelia's Overlithe festival went off without a hitch. The heroes, feeling they deserved a reward for their harrowing efforts delivering pies, quickly began the difficult work of enjoying all the party had to offer. They were instant celebrities, with drinks being pushed on them and requests from the young Hobbits in attendance to tell them tales from lands far away. The heroes happily obliged, telling stories of brave men and women in cities of stone, of kingdoms built in great forests and those carved from the bedrock of the earth.\n\n“Can't say that I've ever had a call to go see all that,” one particularly grumpy Hobbit named Farmer Chubb interjected, “Furthest I've gone is to the other end of the Marish for a chicken delivery. Ended up staying for a few days in the town of Bree. Didn't care for what I saw there, and don't care to see much more,” the farmer said, giving a curt nod and returning his pipe to his mouth for a long slow pull.\n\n“Funny you should mention it,” one of the heroes replied, “for we are heading towards Bree next week.” Farmer Chubb leaned in, “Indeed? You wouldn't mind doing this old farmer a favor on your way would ya? Movin' poultry was easier in years gone past, but I'm getting on into my 90's, and the roads are less certain of late. But ya see, I owe young Farmer Maggot some chickens. I don't suppose I could impose on you to bring them to his farmstead in Bamfurlong?” The heroes agreed, and made plans to set out after breakfast the following morning.\n\nThe festival ran late into the night. All the patrons enjoyed bountiful food, song, and drink. Some among the heroes' group, unaccustomed to the generosities of a Hobbiton party, overindulged themselves, realizing it only when the sun rose bright and early the next day, and a rooster's cry urged them from their beds.\n\nShuffling to the gathering room of the local Inn, the heroes ordered a quick breakfast, trying to muster the motivation to stick to their plan to depart early for their two day journey, with a stop in Woodhall. “I don't think it's as far as all that,” one of the heroes says, slowly rubbing their eyes. “We could sneak in a quick nap before we head out, enjoy a nice second breakfast, and then be in Woodhall before Supper.”\n\n“There's no rush. Why not spend the morning here, have a luncheon in town, and then depart?”\n\n“You heard Farmer Chubb,” one of the heroes reminded the group. “The roads are more dangerous these days. We don't want to get caught out after dark.”\n\nThe heroes looked at one another, bewildered. It seemed they had a decision to make.",

The heroes pounded on the dark door of an inn. “Who's that at this time of night?” A disgruntled voice called, followed by the sound of slow footsteps. A stout middle aged Hobbit answered the door.\n\n“Apologies for the intrusion. May we rent a room for the night? We come on an errand for Bamfurlong, but more urgently we seek the safety of your inn.” Another howl sang out to emphasize the hero's point.\n\n“Best do that,” the innkeeper said grufly, stepping back and beckoning the heroes inside. “Been getting real dangerous at night.”\n\n“That was more than just dangerous,” one of the heroes replied, as they fished in their pack for some bandages. “We found several lumberjacks out of Woodhall dead in Woody End. Then we were ambushed by wolves with a cleverness that felt strategic.”\n\n“Well, you have nothing to fear in my care. Come, let's get you to bed. Things will look better in the morning,” the innkeeper assured the heroes, showing them to a group of entirely too small beds.\n\nThe following morning the heroes rose at first light and made for Bamfurlong without even having first breakfast, let alone second.",

      "flavorIntro": "The heroes awoke just before dawn, feeling cramped and irritable from a night's rest in Farmer Maggot's farmhouse broken by howls of wolves. They shuffled downstairs to find him already at work preparing breakfast. The young farmer greeted his guests warmly, though they could see from the weary look on his face that he too had endured a sleepless night.\n\n“Thank you again for bringing those chickens to me,” he said as he retrieved several plates from a cupboard, “They'll replace those I lost the past few nights. Though, truth be told, if something isn't done about these wolves I may not be able to keep the farm at all.”\n\nThe heroes exchanged grim looks. “Are wolves not a normal sight in the Shire?” one asked.\n\n“Not in these numbers, no. You'll see them from time to time, though the shirriffs are supposed to be shooting them as they can. But these wolves, why, there's something queer about them.” The farmer leaned over the table, as if to share a secret. “They came from the Old Forest. I saw a whole pack of them not a week ago leaving the treeline and swimming across the Brandywine River, yelping and yowling as if something terrible were after them. What do you suppose could scare a whole pack of wolves right into the river?”\n\nThe heroes exchanged quizzical glances. “Trolls?”\n\n“I don't rightly know,” the young farmer admitted, “but there's definitely something out there. I've seen the way my hounds watch the forest at night, and I've heard the strangest sounds during the day, a creaking and groaning carried on the wind as if the trees were in pain. I plan to head out there today, take a look around. If there's anything that may be solved with a well-aimed bow, I plan to do it. Otherwise...” he trailed off.\n\n“Allow us to accompany you, master Maggot,” one of the heroes spoke. “Our journey takes us in that general direction anyway, and if there are indeed trolls out there, then there is safety in numbers.”\n\nFarmer Maggot nodded appreciatively. “I'd be most grateful. Though perhaps we can split up to cover more ground. If I do run into trouble, I'll double back to find you, and we can face it together.” The heroes all agreed.",

      "doNotRead": "The forest itself seemed to have brought the heroes to this clearing to stand torn, bruised, and weary before this ancient poplar tree. The threat of violence loomed all about them, ill-defined but palpable as if brought on by a paranoid fever dream.\n\nOne of the heroes staggered forward, falling to her knees beneath the regal old tree. “What do you want? Why did you bring us here?” She cried out. Then, something caught her gaze: huge gashes across the tree's bark, spilling sap like a fresh wound. “She's injured,” the hero said in a daze. “Someone hurt her; she thinks we mean to finish her off.” Fading fast, the hero collapsed beneath the great tree, a great sleepiness overtaking her. One by one, her companions fell as well, slowly succumbing to an irresistible exhaustion.\n\nSuddenly, a melodic whistle cut through the grim twilight. A man in a bright blue jacket, a feathered hat, and yellow boots came bounding into the clearing. “Grey Lady Poplar,” the man said in an accusatory tone, “these are not your foes! Taking their lives will not heal you. Your enemy has gone from this place. Release these people, and go to sleep!” He gave the great poplar tree a sharp look, one hand on his hip.\n\nA few moments later, the heroes' haze broke. They all sat up at once, gasping for air as if they had unwittingly been holding their breath.\n\n“Good, good! Now, Lady, rest, for you can trust that Tom knows best,” the man's voice was sing-song, and far more cheerful than any of the heroes felt. “You others! Come, get to your feet. My house is near!” Slowly, the heroes stood, dusted themselves off, and followed the strange man further into the woods. It had been their strangest day in the Shire yet, and their adventure was only getting stranger.",

They fled from the goblins’ caves only to be surrounded by wargs in a forest glade!",
        "ruling": "**Setup**\n\nAt the beginning of the *Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim* scenario, players are instructed to create a “riddle area” with stage 2A of the quest deck. Both quest cards are in play simultaneously as explained below.\n\n**The Riddle Area**\n\nStage 1A instructs players to create a riddle area. The riddle area is a new play area, separate from the staging area, that represents Bilbo’s riddling contest against Gollum. The riddle area consists of stage 2 of the quest deck, *Riddles in the Dark*, as well as the Gollum enemy card and the Bilbo’s Magic Ring objective card. Bilbo Baggins is also placed in the riddle area when setting up this scenario.\n\nCards in the riddle area (including Bilbo Baggins) are immune to player card effects and cannot leave the riddle area except through specific quest card effects. While Gollum is in the riddle area, he does not contribute his threat during the quest phase and cannot be engaged by the players. While Bilbo Baggins is in the riddle area, the first player still controls him; however, he cannot quest, attack, take damage from cards other than Gollum, have attachments played on him by the players, or defend (except against Gollum).\n\n**Riddles**\n\n“**Riddle**” is a new game effect featured on some encounter cards. When an encounter card with a riddle effect is revealed from the encounter deck, the first player must choose between resolving that card normally or answering the riddle on that card. The first player can only choose to answer a riddle if it is revealed from the encounter deck. If a card with riddle is dealt as a shadow card, the first player cannot choose to answer it at that time.\n\nTo answer a riddle, the first player must follow the directions printed on the riddle, in the following steps:\n\n*Step 1* - Each riddle effect begins with the text, “The first player names a ___.”\n\nThe first player makes a guess based on the item(s) he is instructed (by the riddle) to name: card type, sphere, or cost.\n\nCard types that can be named are *ally*, *event*, *attachment*, or *treasure*. The spheres that can be named are *leadership*, *spirit*, *lore*, *tactics*, and *Baggins*. Cost can be any number.\n\n*Step 2* - The second part of a riddle is presented by the text, “shuffles his deck and discards the top X cards of his deck.”\n\nThe first player shuffles his deck and then discards X cards from the top of his deck, as determined by the riddle.\n\n*Step 3* - The final part of a riddle effect is presented by the text, “For each of those cards that matches, place 1 progress on stage 2.”\n\nThe first player places 1 progress on stage 2 for each card discarded by the riddle effect that matches the named card type / sphere / cost from step 1. When instructed to name multiple items, a “match” is defined by a card that features each of the named items.",

        "ruling": "**Unconscious Characters**\n\nIn this scenario, when a character has a number of poison attached equal to its printed hit points, that character is immediately made unconscious. This is done by rotating the character card 180 degrees. After a character is made unconscious, the attached poison cards are placed in their owner’s discard pile. Each stage of the *Flies and Spiders* scenario includes the following game text: “*Unconscious characters cannot quest, attack, defend, collect resources, trigger abilities, be poisoned, or ready (except by effects that target unconscious characters)*.” These characters have been incapacitated by the spiders.\n\nIf any number of poison is removed from a character, or that character leaves play, then those poison cards are placed in their owner’s discard pile.\n\n**Ready an Unconscious Character**\n\nWhen a card effect instructs a player to “ready an unconscious character,” that player chooses an unconscious character and rotates that character 180 degrees so that it appears in its ready position. That character is now ready and is no longer considered to be unconscious.\n\n**Creating a Staging Area**\n\nOn stage 2B the players are instructed to “*Reveal stage 3 and create a separate staging area for the first player using that stage*.” To do this the first player sets aside an area in front of himself to serve as his own private staging area. The rest of the players continue to share the original staging area. Only players that share a common staging area can interact with each other in any way. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in turn order, starting with the first player, but the resolution of each phase occurs as if only the player or players that share any given staging area are currently present in the game.\n\n ∙ Players cannot affect other players (or cards controlled by players) that do not share a common staging area. This means that you cannot lower a player’s threat, play an attachment on one of his characters, etc., unless that player shares a staging area with you.\n\n ∙ During the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area. So in a 4 person game, where 3 players share the original staging area, the first player would reveal 1 encounter card and the other players as a group would reveal 3.\n\n ∙ Encounter card effects are limited to each staging area. For example, if an effect references “each player,” then that effect only refers to each player that shares the staging area to which the encounter card would be added.\n\n**Combining Staging Areas**\n\nStage 3B reads: “*When this stage is complete, do not advance to stage 4 until the end of the quest phase. (Combine staging areas if necessary.)*” When the first player places the final progress on this stage he must wait until the end of the quest phase to advance in order to allow the other players to resolve their quest phase. Then, the first player joins the other players at stage 4. Any enemy or location cards in the first player’s staging area are added to the original staging area. Any enemies engaged with the first player remain engaged with that player when the staging areas are combined.",

When Gandalf threw the ring into Frodo’s fireplace, ancient runes appeared on the band that confirmed it was indeed The One Ring, an ancient and indestructible evil.\n\nKnowing that servants of the Enemy would be searching for the Ring, Gandalf told Frodo he must leave the Shire and take the Ring to Elrond in Rivendell. He advised Frodo to sell Bag End and act as if he were moving to Buckland to avoid drawing suspicion before the wizard himself left to seek help.\n\nGandalf promised to return, but danger has arrived sooner than he expected: Black Riders have appeared in the Shire looking for “Baggins” and the Grey Wizard has yet to be seen. Frodo knows he can’t wait any longer. He must move quickly and quietly if he hopes to make it to Buckland alive...",

Yet there was still some hope that Frodo and his companions might find the colony of Dwarves that had been led there years before by Balin son of Fundin, one of Thorin Oakenshield’s renowned companions in the quest for The Lonely Mountain and a friend of Bilbo Baggins.\n\nHowever, the Company of the Ring discovered no sign of Balin’s colony upon entering Moria; instead they were surrounded by constant darkness and a growing dread. With the way behind them blocked by the Watcher in the Water, the Fellowship’s only choice was to make the hazardous journey across the mines to the eastern door many twisting miles away. They hoped to make the crossing in secret but the presence of The One Ring would not go undetected by the evil things lurking in the deep dark...",

Celeborn furnished the Company with boats to take them down the River Anduin, and Galadriel blessed each member of the Fellowship with a unique gift before they said farewell to Lórien.\n\nWhile the boats greatly aided their progress south, the Company was divided over which side of the river they should finally go to. Boromir of Gondor urged them to keep to the west bank and continue south to the city of Minas Tirith where his people prepared for war with the Dark Lord. But in Frodo’s heart he knew the path to Mount Doom lay on the eastern shore, under the shadow of Mordor.

        "ruling": "**Multiple Staging Areas**\n\nWhen playing the *Breaking of the Fellowship*, the players are instructed by stage 2B to create their own staging areas. To do this, each player sets aside an area in front of them to serve as their own staging area and places their quest stage 3 there. Players continue to resolve each phase of the game in player order, starting with the first player.\n\nAfter a player commits characters to the quest at their stage, they reveal their encounter card. Then, they compare the total willpower of their characters committed to the total threat strength of encounter cards in their staging area. If the total willpower is greater, they place progress on their quest stage. If the total threat strength is greater, they raise their threat by the difference. Other players do not raise their threat when a different player quests unsuccessfully.\n\nDuring the encounter phase, players only make engagement checks against enemies in their staging area. Effects that target enemies or locations “at this stage” do not affect encounter cards in another player’s staging area. Archery damage is calculated separately at each stage, and only the player at that stage can assign that damage to characters they control.\n\nUnlike previous scenarios with separate staging areas, players may continue to interact with each other through the normal rules of the game. However, cards that reference “the staging area” only apply to your staging area, and cards that reference “the quest” only apply to your quest stage.\n\nIf a player is eliminated from the game while at a separate stage, that stage is discarded along with all encounter cards at that stage.",

The army of Saruman was utterly defeated and it was time to deal with the treacherous Wizard himself. So it was that Gandalf led Aragorn, Théoden, and the riders of his house to Isengard to parlay with Saruman.\n\nBelieving Isengard to be beyond the strength of his enemies to assault, Saruman had committed nearly all of his forces to the attack on Rohan. Yet, there was an ancient power that the Wizard had failed to account for in his schemes. The trees of Fangorn Forest had suffered much from the axes of Isengard Orcs, and the slow burning anger of the Ents was almost ready to explode.\n\nThe coming of Aragorn’s lost companions to Fangorn Forest with news of Saruman’s treachery was just the spark the Ents needed to rouse them from their inaction. After hearing about Saruman’s part in the great events unfolding in the world around them, the leader of the Ents, Treebeard, called an Entmoot to urge his compatriots to war.\n\nIn their anger, the Ents had the strength to tear down the walls of Isengard and destroy Saruman’s war machines. Still, Saruman was a cunning Wizard. Even when caught off guard, he had many dangerous powers at his command, especially his voice, which could daunt all but the most strong-willed individuals. All of these dangers would have to be faced if the treason of Isengard was to be thwarted...",

The hardship the companions endured was beyond the strength of most mortals, but need drove them and the will of Aragorn held them together.\n\nIn five days’ time, they raced more than ninety leagues to reach the port of Pelargir. At the ford of Gilrain they came upon the men of Lamedon as they fought with Corsair raiders who had sailed up the river. Friend and foe alike fled at their coming for the fear of the dead, but when they reached Pelargir, the Corsairs turned to give battle.\n\nThere upon Anduin, the main strength of the Umbar fleet was gathered for the sack of Gondor. A great army of Corsairs stood before them, and the Grey Company was already tired from the long journey, but Aragorn ordered the Army of the Dead to attack and led his companions into battle once more...",

Orcs issuing from The Black Gate overran the island fortress of Cair Andros, and the main host of Mordor marched forth from Minas Morgul led by The Black Captain, The Witch-king of Angmar.\n\nDenethor, Steward of Gondor, sent messengers to King Theoden in Dunharrow to ask for all his strength to ride to Minas Tirith, and the beacon fires were lit between Gondor and Rohan. Meanwhile, men from the outland fiefs of Gondor marched in to Minas Tirith to bolster the city’s garrison. Yet, they sent less strength than hoped for because of the Corsair threat to the coastlands.\n\nSo it was that The Witch-king found the men of Gondor not wholly unprepared for the assault, but still greatly overmatched by the host of Mordor. On the eve of the attack Mount Doom belched fire, black clouds darkened the sky, and night fell on Minas Tirith. Unless help beyond hope could reach the White City in time, Gondor would surely fall...",
        "ruling": "**Minas Tirith**\n\nMinas Tirith is an objective that is put into play when the players reach stage 3A. The objective represents the White City as it comes under attack during *The Battle of the Pelennor Fields*. If Minas Tirith has damage equal to its hit points at the end of a round, the White City has fallen and the players lose the game.\n\nSeveral encounter card effects target Minas Tirith. If these effects trigger at stage 2B, while Minas Tirith is not in play, the players must resolve the effects as fully as possible.\n\n**Strategy Tip**\n\nWhen playing *The Battle of the Pelennor Fields* there are several triggered effects that need to be observed each round. In order to provide players with the most rewarding adventure, and avoid bogging down the game, these effects were all made to trigger at either the beginning of the quest phase or at the end of the round. For the best play experience, we recommend that the players check for triggered effects at the beginning of each quest phase, and again at the end of the round.\n\nCards to look for in particular are:\n\n ∙ Minas Tirith\n ∙ The Witch-king\n ∙ Grond\n ∙ Wraith on Wings\n ∙ The Corsair Fleet (campaign mode only)",

The sting that poisoned him would eventually wear off, but when he awoke he would find himself a captive of the Orcs.\n\nHorrified by this revelation, Sam determined to rescue his master and followed the Orcs to the tower of Cirith Ungol. When he reached the outer wall, he was surprised to hear the sounds of fighting inside. It seemed that the Orcs were quarreling over what to do with their captive.

There he raised the standard of Elendil and challenged the Dark Lord himself to come forth and face judgement.

      "flavorIntro": "Having barely escaped from the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo and Sam stood momentarily on the edge of the Morgai, the inner fence of Mordor’s western mountain range. Below them they could see the vast plain of Gorgoroth dotted with enemy camps. Sauron was gathering all his strength to Mordor after his defeat at Minas Tirith.\n\nOrcs swarmed like ants upon the ashen plain and countless watchfires flickered across the Black Land like the stars in the sky. As the Hobbits made their way down along the Morgai, there appeared no way for them to reach Mount Doom without being discovered.\n\nThen, to the wonder of the Ring-bearer and his servant, the vast armies of Mordor began to march away north, leaving the path to Orodruin unwatched. Sauron was directing all of his forces to the Morannon where Aragorn had marched his army to challenge the Dark Lord.\n\nNeither of the Hobbits knew this reason, but they could plainly see that this was their opportunity to complete the quest. This final stage would determine the future of Middle-earth: Either the Ring would be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, or the Ring-bearer would be discovered and the Ring would be delivered back to the hand of its dark Master...",
      "ruling": "**Fortitude Tests**\n\nFortitude tests represent the **Ring-bearer’s** courage and determination to complete the quest for Mount Doom in the face of overwhelming adversity. When a player is instructed to make a Fortitude test, he may exhaust any number of heroes he controls to commit them to the test. Then, he must discard the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the tens digit of his threat dial. If the total willpower of the heroes committed to the test is greater than the number of Sauron’s Eye icons on the encounter cards discarded for the test, that player successfully passes the Fortitude test. If the number of Sauron’s Eye icons is equal to or greater than the total willpower of the committed heroes, that player fails the Fortitude test. If the encounter deck is ever empty during a Fortitude test, shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck.\n\n**Player Actions During Fortitude Tests**\n\nFortitude tests interrupt the regular turn sequence and create a new action window. After the total number of Sauron’s Eye icons on the discarded encounter cards has been determined, players are allowed to take actions. Once the Fortitude test is resolved, play continues as normal and player actions are restricted to regular action windows.",

Dead bodies lay strewn among the blackened wreck of a Woodman village. Some had black-feathered arrows sticking from their backs while others were cruelly hewn.\n\n“This is Orc work!” cursed one of the heroes.\n\n“It was... Goblins... did this,” a raspy voice came from one of the figures on the ground. It was a Woodman with an arrow in his back. He struggled to lift his head. “They took... our families,” he groaned. “You must... rescue them!”\n\nThe Woodman’s eyes pleaded with the heroes even as his strength failed him. One of the companions knelt at his side and spoke, “We will find your people and rescue them if we can, or avenge them if we cannot. You have my word.”\n\nThe injured man nodded and exhaled his last breath. Wasting no time, the heroes searched for sign of the Goblins’ trail. It was easy enough to find: a heavy trampling that led deeper into the forest. The heroes drew their weapons and followed the trail into the woods.",

From this hidden stronghold, they would issue forth at times to raid the Woodmen who dared live under the shadow of Mirkwood.\n\nIt was these Goblins that the heroes pursued through the forest, and it was their captives that the companions had sworn to rescue. So it was that the heroes discovered the entrance to the Goblins’ hidden lair and entered to fulfill their oath.",
