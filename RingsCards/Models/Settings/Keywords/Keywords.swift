If there is disagreement as to where to assign archery damage, the first player makes the final decision. If multiple cards with the archery keyword are in play, the effects are cumulative.

At the beginning of the combat phase, each player removes one progress from the current quest for each enemy with Hinder engaged with him. When there is no progress remaining on the current quest, players remove progress from the active location instead.

    Keyword(id: 21, code: "uncharted", name: "Uncharted", text: "Uncharted locations represent unknown areas of Middle-earth, untouched and unexplored during this age of the world. As such, the players do not know what to expect when traveling to them.\n\nThese locations are double-sided. One side is called \"Lost Island,\" and has the Uncharted keyword. Uncharted locations are always added to the staging area with the \"Lost Island\" side faceup, without looking at the other side of the card. Locations with the Uncharted keyword do not have quest points and cannot be explored by placing progress on them, although progress may still be placed on them (in order to trigger their **Action** ability).\n\nEach copy of Lost Island has the following text: \"**Forced**: After Lost Island becomes the active location, flip it over.\" Thus, by traveling to an Uncharted location, the players can discover what kind of location it really is, flipping it over to its other side. **Flipping over an Uncharted location removes all progress from it**. Once flipped, it functions as a normal location, with the following exceptions: Double-sided locations cannot enter the encounter deck. If a double-sided location would enter the discard pile, it is instead shuffled back into the Uncharted deck, Lost Island side faceup.\n\nEach copy of Lost Island also has the following text: \"**Action**: Remove 4 progress from Lost Island to look at its facedown side.\" Thus, by placing progress on a Lost Island card in the staging area, the players may look at its facedown side in order to gain information about where to travel.\n\nMany locations on the other side of an Uncharted location have **Forced** effects that trigger after they are flipped. After flipping an Uncharted location, make sure to check the newly flipped location for any such effects. Note that \"looking\" at the facedown side of an Uncharted location does not trigger any of these effects.\n\nNote that all copies of Lost Island have the Ruins of NÃºmenor encounter set icon on their Lost Island side, even though some of these cards may actually belong to different encounter sets."),
    Keyword(id: 22, code: "aflame-x", name: "Aflame X", text: "Many of the locations in this scenario have the Aflame X keyword. This represents ships in the Elven fleet and piers in the Grey Havens which are under attack by Corsairs and are being set on fire.\n\nAt the end of each round, the players must place 1 damage token on each Aflame location in the staging area. Many encounter card effects can also cause damage tokens to be placed on Aflame locations.\n\nIf at any point an Aflame location has damage tokens on it equal to its Aflame X value, it is destroyed, and must be placed facedown underneath The Havens Burn objective card. Cards facedown underneath The Havens Burn are considered to be out of play.\n\nIf an Aflame location is explored, it is placed in the discard pile as normal, and all damage tokens on it are also discarded."),
    Keyword(id: 23, code: "grapple", name: "Grapple", text: "Grapple is a keyword that represents the many tentacles of the sea-beast grasping onto different parts of the *Stormcaller*. When an enemy with the Grapple keyword is revealed, or when you are instructed to resolve an enemy's Grapple keyword, immediately attach that enemy **facedown** to the location in the staging area specified in parentheses (for example, the location with the highest [threat], or the highest quest points). If more than one location meets the specified criteria, the first player may choose which of those locations the enemy grapples. If there are no locations in the staging area, add the enemy to the staging area without attaching it to any location. While attached to a location by the Grapple keyword, an enemy is \"grappled with\" that location.\n\nWhile grappled with a location, an enemy is not considered to be in the staging area, cannot be engaged, and is immune to player card effects. **Instead, it adds 2 [threat] to the [threat] of the location it is grappled with**.\n\nWhen a location becomes the active location, or when a location in the staging area is explored, any enemies grappled with that location are detached, flipped faceup, and added to the staging area as normal enemies. Thus, by traveling to a location, the players can engage and attack the tentacles grappled with that location, freeing the *Stormcaller* from the creature's grasp!"),
    Keyword(id: 24, code: "exploration", name: "Exploration", text: "The Exploration keyword on the main quest represents the player's ability to traverse the Island Map prepared during the setup of the scenario. In this scenario, locations are not revealed from the encounter deck, and the entire island is laid out for the players to explore, one location at a time.\n\nLocations in the Island Map cannot leave the Island Map for any reason, nor can they leave their individual positions within the island (for example, an effect that would switch two locations does not work in this scenario). The Island Map is not the same as the staging area and does not function in the same way. Note that there is still a staging area, which is used for enemies and other cards that would be placed into the staging area.\n\nDuring this scenario, the active location is represented through the use of an \"active location marker,\" which can be a resource token or a pawn/figurine of the players' choice. **The active location is not moved out of its place in the island map when the players travel to it. The locations adjacent (orthogonally, not diagonally) to the active location are considered to be in the staging area**. All of the other locations on the Island Map are not considered to be in the staging area.\n\nWhen the players quest successfully, progress is still placed on the active location before it is placed on the current quest, up to that location's quest points, as normal. However, if progress is placed on any location equal to its quest points, it is not immediately explored. Instead, it remains in play.\n\nDuring the Travel phase, if the active location has progress on it equal to its quest points, the players have the option to travel to a location in the staging area (i.e. an adjacent location). If the active location does not have enough progress on it, they cannot travel from it. **If the players travel to another location, all progress is removed from the active location, and their active location marker is moved to the new location**. At this point, the formerly active location is considered \"explored,\" although **it is not discarded or flipped over**, and remains in place. Because players always travel from one location directly to another in this scenario, there is always an active location at any given moment in time. Remember that flipping an Uncharted location also removes all progress from it.\n\nPlayers can freely travel around the Island Map using the above rules, and may return to locations they have already explored. Your goal is to find the entrance to the underwater Grotto which is somewhere inside the grand temple the three locations on the rightmost side of the Island Map. But, in order to enter the Temple, you must find the Gate Key somewhere on the island."),
    Keyword(id: 25, code: "track", name: "Track", text: "Track is a keyword that represents the heroes' efforts to locate their missing companions somewhere in the spiders' labyrinth. After the players travel to a location, if they are off track, they discard X cards from the encounter deck, where X is the active location's Track value. If any of the discarded cards has On Track printed in the lower right corner, then the players flip the **Search** objective to On Track. If the encounter deck is ever empty while the players are resolving the Track keyword, shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and continue resolving the Track keyword. When the **Search** objective is flipped from Off Track to On Track, discard all resources on it."),

X is a card type: enemy or location. When a card with guarded (X) enters play, discard cards from the encounter deck until an encounter card with the matching type is discarded. Then, add that card to the staging area and attach the guarded (X) card to it as a guarded objective. Once attached, an objective with guarded (X) works just like an objective with the original guarded keyword. If the encounter deck is empty while resolving the Guarded (X) keyword, shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and finish resolving the guarded (X) keyword.\n\nA player card attachment with the guarded (X) keyword cannot be attached to a character until it is free of encounters. Once free of encounters, its owner gains control of it and attaches it to an eligible card."),

That location then becomes the active location.

Look at the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is the active locations Discover value.\n\n  2. Choose 1 looked at objective with the Loot keyword and attach it to the active location as a guarded objective.\n\n  3. Randomly select 1 looked at card with the **Hazard** trait, reveal it and add it to the staging area.\n\n  4.

Quest cards with the race keyword cannot be defeated outside of the quest phase, and progress cannot be placed on them by player card effects.\n\nWhen a quest stage with the race keyword is defeated, it is not removed from play after it is defeated.

If players are instructed to draw multiple cards from the sack deck, those cards are drawn and resolved one at a time.\n\nIf the Sack X keyword is triggered and there are no cards remaining in the sack deck, the Sack X effect is ignored.
