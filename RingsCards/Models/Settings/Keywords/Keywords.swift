The objective cannot be claimed as long as any encounter card is attached. Once that encounter is dealt with, the objective remains in the staging area until it is claimed. If another objective card comes up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the second objective in the staging area, and use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfil the original keyword effect. Enemy and location cards attached to guarded objectives do still count their threat while the enemy or location is in the staging area. An encounter card attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the following method, depending on its card type:\n ∙ Enemy: The enemy leaves play, either by being defeated or as the result of a card effect.\n ∙ Location: The location leaves play, either by being fully explored or as the result of a card effect.\n ∙ Treachery: The treachery's effects resolve, or are cancelled (Treachery cards are immediately triggered when they are revealed.)\nOnce all encounter cards attached to a guarded objective are dealt with, the players can claim the objective in the manner specified by its card text."),

This damage can be dealt to characters under any player's control, and it can be divided among the players as they see fit. If there is disagreement as to where to assign archery damage, the first player makes the final decision. If multiple cards with the archery keyword are in play, the effects are cumulative. Remember that [defense] does not block archery damage."),

When a card with the Time X keyword is revealed, the players put X resource tokens on that card. These tokens are called \"time counters.\" At the end of each refresh phase, remove 1 time counter from each card with the Time X keyword, if able. When the last time counter is removed, there will be a triggered effect that resolves on that card. Some encounter cards will also remove time counters, making it more difficult for the players to predict when they will run out of time."),

When a location with the Searches X keyword leaves play, the player (or players) identified by that location reveals the top X cards of his out-of-play deck.

Instead of making attacks, enemies with the Hinder keyword force players to remove progress from the current quest or active location. At the beginning of the combat phase, each player removes one progress from the current quest for each enemy with Hinder engaged with him. When there is no progress remaining on the current quest, players remove progress from the active location instead. If there is no progress on either the quest or active location, there is no effect."),
    Keyword(id: 16, code: "scour", name: "Scour", text: "Scour is a new keyword that represents the efforts of Bellach and his minions to discover Celebrimbor's hidden forge and the heroes who seek it. The scour keyword does nothing by itself, but when the players are instructed by quest card or encounter card text to trigger a scour effect they must resolve the effect that follows the scour keyword on that card.

    Keyword(id: 20, code: "sailing", name: "Sailing", text: "Sailing is a keyword that represents that the players are currently traveling across the sea on their ships. At the beginning of each quest phase (before committing characters to the quest), if the main quest has the Sailing keyword, the first player must perform a Sailing test."),
    Keyword(id: 21, code: "aflame-x", name: "Aflame X", text: "Many of the locations in this scenario have the Aflame X keyword. This represents ships in the Elven fleet and piers in the Grey Havens which are under attack by Corsairs and are being set on fire.\nAt the end of each round, the players must place 1 damage token on each Aflame location in the staging area. Many encounter card effects can also cause damage tokens to be placed on Aflame locations.\nIf at any point an Aflame location has damage tokens on it equal to its Aflame X value, it is destroyed, and must be placed facedown underneath The Havens Burn objective card. Cards facedown underneath The Havens Burn are considered to be out of play.\nIf an Aflame location is explored, it is placed in the discard pile as normal, and all damage tokens on it are also discarded."),
    Keyword(id: 22, code: "uncharted", name: "Uncharted", text: "Uncharted locations represent unknown areas of Middle-earth, untouched and unexplored during this age of the world. As such, the players do not know what to expect when traveling to them.\nThese locations are double-sided. One side is called \"Lost Island,\" and has the Uncharted keyword. Uncharted locations are always added to the staging area with the \"Lost Island\" side faceup, without looking at the other side of the card. Locations with the Uncharted keyword do not have quest points and cannot be explored by placing progress on them, although progress may still be placed on them (in order to trigger their Action ability).\nEach copy of Lost Island has the following text: \"Forced: After Lost Island becomes the active location, flip it over.\" Thus, by traveling to an Uncharted location, the players can discover what kind of location it really is, flipping it over to its other side. Flipping over an Uncharted location removes all progress from it. Once flipped, it functions as a normal location, with the following exceptions: Double-sided locations cannot enter the encounter deck. If a double-sided location would enter the discard pile, it is instead shuffled back into the Uncharted deck, Lost Island side faceup.\nEach copy of Lost Island also has the following text: \"Action: Remove 4 progress from Lost Island to look at its facedown side.\" Thus, by placing progress on a Lost Island card in the staging area, the players may look at its facedown side in order to gain information about where to travel.\nMany locations on the other side of an Uncharted location have Forced effects that trigger after they are flipped. After flipping an Uncharted location, make sure to check the newly flipped location for any such effects. Note that \"looking\" at the facedown side of an Uncharted location does not trigger any of these effects.\nNote that all copies of Lost Island have the Ruins of NÃºmenor encounter set icon on their Lost Island side, even though some of these cards may actually belong to different encounter sets."),
    Keyword(id: 23, code: "grapple", name: "Grapple", text: "Grapple is a keyword that represents the many tentacles of the sea beast grasping onto different parts of the Stormcaller, threatening to pull the ship underwater. When an enemy with the Grapple keyword is revealed, or when you are instructed to resolve an enemy's Grapple keyword, immediately attach that enemy facedown to the location in the staging area specified in parentheses (for example, the location with the highest , or the highest quest points). If more than one location meets the specified criteria, the first player may choose which of those locations the enemy grapples. If there are no locations in the staging area, add the enemy to the staging area without attaching it to any location. While attached to a location by the Grapple keyword, an enemy is \"grappled with\" that location.\nWhile grappled with a location, an enemy is not considered to be in the staging area, cannot be engaged, and is immune to player card effects. Instead, it adds 2 to the  of the location it is grappled with.\nWhen a location becomes the active location, or when a location in the staging area is explored, any enemies grappled with that location are detached, flipped faceup, and added to the staging area as normal enemies. Thus, by traveling to a location, the players can engage and attack the tentacles grappled with that location, freeing the Stormcaller from the creature's grasp!"),
    Keyword(id: 24, code: "exploration", name: "Exploration", text: "The Exploration keyword on the main quest represents the player's ability to traverse the Island Map prepared during the setup of the scenario. In this scenario, locations are not revealed from the encounter deck, and the entire island is laid out for the players to explore, one location at a time.\nLocations in the Island Map cannot leave the Island Map for any reason, nor can they leave their individual positions within the island (for example, an effect that would switch two locations does not work in this scenario). The Island Map is not the same as the staging area and does not function in the same way. Note that there is still a staging area, which is used for enemies and other cards that would be placed into the staging area.\nDuring this scenario, the active location is represented through the use of an \"active location marker,\" which can be a resource token or a pawn/figurine of the players' choice. The active location is not moved out of its place in the island map when the players travel to it. The locations adjacent (orthogonally, not diagonally) to the active location are considered to be in the staging area. All of the other locations on the Island Map are not considered to be in the staging area.\nWhen the players quest successfully, progress is still placed on the active location before it is placed on the current quest, up to that location's quest points, as normal. However, if progress is placed on any location equal to its quest points, it is not immediately explored. Instead, it remains in play.\nDuring the Travel phase, if the active location has progress on it equal to its quest points, the players have the option to travel to a location in the staging area (i.e. an adjacent location). If the active location does not have enough progress on it, they cannot travel from it. If the players travel to another location, all progress is removed from the active location, and their active location marker is moved to the new location. At this point, the formerly active location is considered \"explored,\" although it is not discarded or flipped over, and remains in place. Because players always travel from one location directly to another in this scenario, there is always an active location at any given moment in time. Remember that flipping an Uncharted location also removes all progress from it.\nPlayers can freely travel around the Island Map using the above rules, and may return to locations they have already explored. Your goal is to find the entrance to the underwater Grotto which is somewhere inside the grand temple the three locations on the rightmost side of the Island Map. But, in order to enter the Temple, you must find the Gate Key somewhere on the island."),
    Keyword(id: 25, code: "track", name: "Track", text: "Track is a keyword that represents the heroes' efforts to locate their missing companions somewhere in the spiders' labyrinth. After the players travel to a location, if they are off track, they discard X cards from the encounter deck, where X is the active location's Track value. If any of the discarded cards has On Track printed in the lower right corner, then the players flip the Search objective to On Track. If the encounter deck is ever empty while the players are resolving the Track keyword, shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and continue resolving the Track keyword. When the Search objective is flipped from Off Track to On Track, discard all resources on it."),

When a card with Guarded (X) is revealed, instead of revealing the next card from the encounter deck, discard cards from the encounter deck until an encounter card with the matching type is discarded. Then, add it to the staging area and attach the just revealed objective to it. Once attached, an objective with Guarded (X) works just like and objective with the Guarded keyword."),
    Keyword(id: 27, code: "deep", name: "Deep", text: "After the players travel to a Deep location, they discard it and replace it with the top card of the Caves deck. That location then becomes the active location. If there are no cards remaining in the Caves deck, the Deep keyword is ignored."),

Quest cards with the race keyword cannot be defeated outside of the quest phase, and progress cannot be placed on them by player card effects.\nWhen a quest stage with the race keyword is defeated, it is not removed from play after it is defeated. Instead, the quest stage remains in play and all progress is removed from it at the end of the phase."),
